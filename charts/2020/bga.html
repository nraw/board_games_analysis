Why don't the gods put an end to this macabre circus? Why does Xelor himself turn a blind eye to the demons' meddling with time's delicate web? Well, you may ask, but it is not for us mortals to know the minds of the gods.\n\nKrosmaster: Arena is a player-vs-player, tactical card game with anime-style miniatures that offers the craftiest tacticians among you the chance to challenge other players to heated battles in arenas scattered around Hormonde. All players build their team using a pre-determined method, whether a point system, draft, or at random. Equip your team with spells, weapons and other items adapted to their requirements, then utilize their various talents and abilities to create a powerful fighting force. Every figure has a point value attached to it to help balance things out. Randomly drawn event cards spice up the game at each turn, and the winning conditions differ for each game based on the scenario you choose to play. Only those who are able to create a strong, yet versatile, strategy will prevail!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "164064", "name": "Krosmaster: Arena \u2013 Adamai Promo"}, {"id": "145538", "name":

Their ultimate goal is the tomb of the pharaoh, but many treasures can be collected as they search. As they explore, the challenge unfolds: The player who manages to quickly get their team of adventurers to the tomb, while salvaging as many treasures as possible, will be the winner.\n\nLuxor offers variable game play as the path that leads to the tomb is different for every game \u2014 and will even change during play!\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\nIn Luxor, players move their adventurers through the temple with the goal of reaching the tomb in the middle of the game board. At the start of the game each player gets dealt 5 cards, which he is not allowed to change the order of.\n\nIn each round players take turns that consist of 3 actions:\n\n1. Choose either the left or right most card to play to the discard pile.\n\nAccording to the played card move, one adventurer that many tiles forward towards the tomb. An adventurer only moves from tile to tile, jumping over empty spaces and not counting them.\n\n2. When the adventurer has completed his movement, he performs the action of that tile, if possible. Depending on the tile this can have various effects:\n\nTreasure tile - If enough of a players adventurers player are placed on a tile, the player can collect that tile and earn points for it. Additionally he keeps the tile, trying to collect treasure sets consisting of the three different treasure kinds, vase, statue and necklace.\n\nHorus tile - The player can either gain a key or a Horus Card. He will need the key to enter the tomb and the special Horus card offers unique and strong ways to move his adventurers once he plays that card.\n\nOsiris tile - The tile acts as an catapult instantly moving the adventurer a certain amount of tiles forward.\n\nTemple tile - On these tiles players get special bonuses, like scarabs that are worth victory points or joker tiles, which complete treasure sets. The most unique tile is the tunnel. If an adventurer lands on a tunnel he instantly gets teleported to the next tunnel in play, creating a shortcut through the temple.\n\n3. After performing the action of the tile, players draw one card from the draw pile to refill their hand to five cards. The drawn card is placed in the middle of the hand.\n\nAt the start of the game, players can chose to move one of 2 adventurers. Every time an adventurer crosses over an Anubis statue for the first time he gains a new adventurer which is placed at the start.\n\nThe game ends once two adventurers reach the tomb. But in order to get in the tomb and collect the valuable sarcophagi, players need to have a key, which they collect from landing on Horus tiles. One key is needed for each adventurer wanting to enter the tomb.\n\nThe round is finished and then the game ends with a final scoring.\n\nThe player who now has the most points is the winner!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "256951", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018"}, {"id": "257185", "name": "Luxor: Exclusive Queenie"}, {"id": "247289", "name": "Luxor: Queenie 1 \u2013 Swarm of Scarabs"}, {"id": "247292", "name": "Luxor: Queenie 2 \u2013 The Snake God's Boon"}, {"id": "247290", "name": "Luxor: Queenie 3 \u2013 Secret Missions"}, {"id": "247291", "name": "Luxor: Queenie 4 \u2013 The Treasure Chamber"}, {"id": "263975", "name": "Luxor: The Gift of Luxor"}, {"id": "269112", "name": "Luxor: The Mummy's Curse"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 2631, "average": 7.23834, "bayesaverage": 6.57907, "stddev": 1.2096, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3949, "trading": 43, "wanting": 216, "wishing": 904, "numcomments": 495, "numweights": 75, "averageweight": 1.9733, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 880}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 196}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 52, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "2": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "3": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 18}}}, "usersrated": 2631.0, "average": 7.23834, "bayesaverage": 6.57907, "stddev": 1.2096, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3949.0, "trading": 43.0, "wanting": 216.0, "wishing": 904.0, "numcomments": 495.0, "numweights": 75.0, "averageweight": 1.9733, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 880}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 196}], "game_family": "Luxor", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "85005", "name": "The Boss", "alternative_names": ["\u0411\u043e\u0441\u0441", "\u0411\u043e\u0441\u0441", "\u9ed1\u5e6b\u8001\u5927"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yq8_IeVY2vxH8q7HFLDblA__thumb/img/_xvzvwWlaGoXn-uAnm3-5_arqaU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1091844.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yq8_IeVY2vxH8q7HFLDblA__original/img/LVhb0mqu1Ffm4xaZfDLiNCefCWQ=/0x0/pic1091844.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: USA", "Series: Europe Collection (Blue Orange Games)"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction", "Mafia"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Auction/Bidding"], "designers": ["Alain Ollier"], "artists": ["Tony Rochon"], "publishers": ["Blackrock Games", "ABBA Games", "Blue Orange Games", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Jolly Thinkers", "Magellan", "Mancalamaro", "Playhouse Ltd", "Raven Distribution"], "description": "With each card played, you gain more information about the loot \u2014 or sanctions \u2014 that may be yours for the taking in different American cities.

Block someone from stealing coins from you.\n\n\nOn your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:\n\n\n     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.\n     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.\n     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)\n\n\nWhen you take one of the character actions \u2013 whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action \u2013 that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.\n\nIf you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.\n\nThe last player to still have influence \u2013 that is, a face-down character \u2013 wins the game!\n\nA new & optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards & Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.\n\n\n     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck.

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.\n\nEach player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.\n\nThe resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.\n\nDuring each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \"Trader\" or \"Builder\"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \"Builder\" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.\n\nPuerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.\n\nPlayers earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.\n\nIn 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I \u2013 New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II \u2013 The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "286086", "name": "Deutscher

The players of the same team are \"Partners\".\n\nEach player is dealt 5 cards and can see them in his/her hand. Then another card (The Return) is revealed in the middle of the table. Starting in the clockwise seat from the dealer, each player has a choice to take The Return card or pass to the next player. If everyone passes 2 times, the round is closed.\n\nThe player who chose to take The Return is called The Sender. The Sender's team are the attackers (Contractant), the other team is designated as defenders (Defendant).\n\nDuring the first selection round, the Return's suit dictates the Trump suit for the round. During the second selection round, The Sender picks between the Trump suit, no Trump, or all Trumps.\n\nThen each player receives 3 cards, except the Sender who only receives 2 cards (The Return counts as the 3rd card).\n\nAt the end of the Deal, each player has 8 cards in his/her hand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlay Phase\n\nThe Opener starts the 1rst Trick and puts at the center of the table a card from his/her hand face up. Then, when his/her turn comes, each player must play one card face up.\nThe one who starts may play any card from his/her hand, the suit of this card is the \"requested\" suit.\nThe other players follow the rules below:\n\n     When you have the requested suit\n         You must play a card of the suit and if the Trump is requested, if possible, you must play a Trump card that beats all previous ones.\n    \n     When you don't have the requested suit and one of your partners is \"Master\"\n         You can play any card of your choice,\n         Or, in order to become \"Master\", you can Trump (play a Trump card) or Over*trump if someone has already played a Trump card.\n    \n     When you don't have the required series and the opposing team is \"Master\"\n         If you can become \"Master\" you must Trump or Over*trump,\n         If you can't become \"Master\", you can play any card of your choice.\n    \n\n\n\n\n3 principles to determine the \"Master\" card:\n\n     The Trump prevails against normal suits.\n     Among the suits of the same rank, the requested suit wins.\n     In the same suit, the card of higher rank wins.\n\n\n\n\nNormal suits\nRank\n    A     10     H     K     Q     J     9     8     7     6     5     4\nValue\n    12 pts     10 pts     7 pts     5 pts     4 pts     3 pts     2 pts     1 pt     0 pt     0 pt     0 pt     0 pt\nThe Trump\nRank\n    9     8     7     A     10     H     K     Q     J     6     5     4\nValue\n    27 pts     22 pts     14 pts     12 pts     10 pts     7 pts     5 pts     4 pts     3 pts     0 pt     0 pt     0 pt\nThe sum of the points is (3 x 44 pts) + 104 pts = 236 pts.\nWhen a Trick is finished, the one who played the \"Master\" card wins, puts the trick with hidden face in front of him/her and begins the next trick.\nWhen the players have no cards left, it is the end of the round.\n\nA Bonus is an event, announced or not, which corresponds to a number of points that a team will add to its tricks points: The Bonuses help to fulfill the Contract.\n\n     The Ten additional: 10 pts which are always awarded to the team that wins the last trick.\n     The Capot: 154 pts awarded to a team which wins all the tricks.\n     The KQ: 20 pts for the team of the player who has announced \"KQ\" during the round. The bonus is confirmed if:\n         A player had the Trump cards King (K) and Queen (Q) in his/her hand,\n         These cards have been played in this order: the King then the Queen,\n         This player has said \"K\" playing the King and \"KQ\" playing the Queen.\n    \n     The KQJ: 50 pts for the team of the player who has announced \"KQJ\" during the round.

Secondly, whether it matched or not, the player then draws the first card from the face down deck, and proceeds the same way: if it doesn't match any card, the drawn card stays on the table, but if it does match a card, the player wins both cards which he adds to his collection. Then the other player takes his turn.\n\nTurn's End: At the end of a player's turn, if he has any Yaku, he can stop the current month (inning) by stating his Yakus, then the points are scored and the next month begins. However, if he wishes to continue in order to increase his score for this month, he says \"Koi-Koi\" and the other player takes his turn. If later on during the game, the player who said Koi-Koi wins another Yaku OR increases his previous Yakus, he can then again stop the game or say Koi-Koi, as many times as he wants. But if a player gets a Yaku in a game where his opponent already said Koi-Koi, then he gets the right either to say Koi-Koi too, or to stop the game and receive his points, thus leading his opponent to get no points at all this month.\n\nEnd: Since each player has 8 cards in his hand, a month (inning) can at worse last 16 turns. In case of a game where one (or both) player(s) said Koi-Koi and no more Yakus have been added or increased before the month ends, then only the last player who said Koi-Koi scores his points as usual. The winner of a month becomes the dealer for the next month, or stays the same if there was not any winner.\n\nEach Yaku can add itself to the others. Here are the Yakus:\n\nBasic Yakus\n\n10 Flowers / Kasu : 1 point (Each additional Flower adds 1 point)\n5 Ribbons / Tanzaku : 1 point (Each additional Ribbon adds 1 point)\n3 Purple Ribbons (blue) / Aotan : 5 points\n3 Ribbons with Poems (red) / Akatan : 5 points\n5 Animals / Tane : 1 Point (Each additional Animal adds 1 point)\nDoe + Boar + Butterflies / Ino Shika Ch\u00f4 : 5 Points\n3 Specials without the Rain Man / Sank\u00f4 : 5 Points\n4 Specials with the Rain Man / Ameshik\u00f4 : 6 points\n4 Special without the Rain Man / Shik\u00f4 : 8 Points\n5 Specials : Gok\u00f4 : 10 points\n\nSpecial Yakus\n\nThe Moon + The Sake Cup / Tsukizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)\nThe Cherry Curtain + The Sake Cup / Hanamizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)\nThe Iris Flower is a \"Joker\" card: it can either be counted as an Animal, or as Flower to form a Kasu (but not both).\nThe 4 Cards of the current Month / TsukiFuda : 5 points\nNo Yakus / OyaKen : 1 point\n\nThe game ends when one player reaches 50 points. In some variants, at the end of a month, the points scored by a player are subtracted from his opponent's score. In some variants, the player with the most points at the end of the year (December) wins the game.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 0, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 0, "stats": {"usersrated": 340, "average": 6.70074, "bayesaverage": 5.70364, "stddev": 1.65522, "median": 0.0, "owned": 369, "trading": 4, "wanting": 8, "wishing": 52, "numcomments": 91, "numweights": 13, "averageweight": 1.6154, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4700}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 232}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 1186}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 9, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "2": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 3}}}, "usersrated": 340.0, "average": 6.70074, "bayesaverage": 5.70364, "stddev": 1.65522, "median": 0.0, "owned": 369.0, "trading": 4.0, "wanting": 8.0, "wishing": 52.0, "numcomments": 91.0, "numweights": 13.0, "averageweight": 1.6154, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4700}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 232}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 1186}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "11929", "name": "Go-Moku", "alternative_names": ["5 p\u00e5 stribe", "Am\u0151ba", "Comoko", "Fem p\u00e5 Stribe", "Five in a Row", "F\u00fcnf in einer Reihe", "Gewinn mit 5", "Gin Checkers", "Go & Gobang", "Go Bang", "Go Und Gobang", "Go+Gobang", "Go-Bang", "Go-Muku", "Gobang", "Gomoku", "Gomoku-narabe", "J\u00e4tk\u00e4nshakki", "Kreuzeln", "Luffarschack", "Wu Zi Qi", "\u4e94\u5b50\u68cb"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fs8TQKCubp_gpLE-x_g4wQ__thumb/img/GEmtiFmhNOXxB5upvlqLL1ukTYY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic128645.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fs8TQKCubp_gpLE-x_g4wQ__original/img/ciF51whYooeGYog6BFTiIjHIvTM=/0x0/pic128645.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Category: n in a row", "Series: Traveller (Ravensburger)", "Traditional Games: Go"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Pattern Building"], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "artists": ["Manfred Burggraf"], "publishers": ["(Public Domain)", "(Unknown)", "ABRA", "Alga", "Arxon", "ASS Altenburger Spielkarten", "Copp Clark Publishing Company", "Du\u00e0n De L\u01d0 (\u6bb5\u7684\u7406)", "IQ Products", "Jian Lun (\u5251\u4f26)", "John Jaques of London", "John W.

The name means \"five points.\"\n\nIt is debated whether this game originated in China or Japan, with more evidence pointing to the former.\n\nThe object is to get five stones in a row.  The game is played on a 19x19 board (such as the board used in Go), creating a large and open field to complete this objective. The game can also be played on a smaller board, such as the popular 15x15 option.\n\nIf played perfectly, Black (who goes first) can always win the game. Even before this was proven, the game was recognized to be easier for Black.

Younger readers are also able to play, as the game is very educational for teaching sentence structure and increasing vocabulary, while being fun at the same time!\n\nThe players represent retired super heroes and reformed super villains who have gotten together, years later, to reminisce about their earlier adventures.  However, as always happens at occasions like this, each is trying to outdo their peers by bragging about an even more amazing story of what they once did.  But the funny part is that everyone's memories are faulty because they are now going senile, and they're relying on their \"friends\" to help them fill in the blanks!  So while the hero or villain might really have a great story to tell, what comes out of their mouth ends up being VERY different.  Each player has two goals - 1) To be the best at helping the other players in remembering correctly, and 2) To come up with their own memory/adventure that their peers agree is the best one of all!\n\nRemember When ... comes with hundreds of unique cards, each with 4 words/phrases on it's 4 sides.  There are ZERO repeats, meaning there are billions of different combinations!  There are also several blank cards for players to create their own.  On the Active Player's turn they are creating a memory with 7 or 8 (if using the optional Orange cards) different cards representing a different part of the memory.  1) WHEN they did this, 2) WHERE they did this, 3) HOW they did this (i.e. Adverb), 4) The ACTION that they took (i.e. Verb), 5) The DESCRIPTION of the object of their memory (i.e. Adjective), 6) The OBJECT of their memory (i.e. Noun), and 7) WHY they took this action.  For example, \"Remember When ..., while looking for my other sock, in the crowded grocery store, I repeatedly kissed the furry caveman because the Great Conjunction was at hand!?\"\n\nBut the Active Player does not create this Sentence/Memory from their own cards.  The other players are rapidly trying to assist the Active Player by submitting one card each.  The Object and the Action Taken are determined first and read out loud, so the players have some context for their card submissions.  Once one card of a type/color (i.e. \"Blue\") has been submitted then another available color must be submitted.  As the players submit their cards to the Active Player, face down, they are trying to guess which of those 4 words/phrases the Active Player will actually choose.  If they are correct in their guesses then both they and the Active Player will get points for matching.\n\nOnce the Active Player has assembled their sentence, scored it for \"helping points\", then they read the completed sentence aloud (we suggest as dramatically as possible).  This is because the other players will be voting on which memory of the evening is the most exciting of all!\n\nAlso try the game out FOR FREE online at Board Game Arena!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "250276", "name": "Remember When ...: FLASHBACKS Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 9, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 51, "average": 6.5451, "bayesaverage": 5.51421, "stddev": 2.26649, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11, "trading": 1, "wanting": 5, "wishing": 14, "numcomments": 12, "numweights": 2, "averageweight": 1.5, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 14438}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 2, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "6": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "7": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "8": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "9": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "9+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}}}, "usersrated": 51.0, "average": 6.5451, "bayesaverage": 5.51421, "stddev": 2.26649, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11.0, "trading": 1.0, "wanting": 5.0, "wishing": 14.0, "numcomments": 12.0, "numweights": 2.0, "averageweight": 1.5, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 14438}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "117663", "name": "Piraten kapern", "alternative_names": ["1000 Bommen & Granaten!", "D\u00e9s Pirates", "Fortune", "Isla Calavera", "Mille Sabords!", "Pirati!", "Pir\u00e1tsk\u00e9 kostky", "\u03a4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03af \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd", "\u05d0\u05d5\u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5 \u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ASvNr8Z7n4uuXiIeKTCpjA__thumb/img/yFj9eUDNMh0UrCugHmxPouZoaM8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5755894.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ASvNr8Z7n4uuXiIeKTCpjA__original/img/QTMAQYFq2wD_k1b1CT4Z44BqkAw=/0x0/pic5755894.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Series: AMIGO dice games in box"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Pirates"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Push Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Haim Shafir"], "artists": ["Mario Barbati", "Rafael Jos\u00e9 Pardo Mac\u00edas", "Jose Pedro"], "publishers": ["999 Games", "AMIGO", "Gigamic", "Giochi Uniti", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Kikigagne?", "Mercurio", "Shafir Games (\u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d7\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8)"], "description": "Piraten Kapern is the German version of the 2011 game Otsarot o Tsarot, published by Shafir Games in Hebrew and English.\n\nAs you might expect with a game titled Piraten Kapern, part of a line of combined dice-and-card games that publisher AMIGO Spiel introduced in 2012, players must set off in search of treasure, pushing themselves to find as much as possible without losing their heads.\n\nAt the start of a turn, the active player rolls the eight special dice. He must set aside any skulls rolled, and his turn ends immediately with no score if he rolls a third skull. The player is free to set aside any number of other dice, rerolling the rest. He may continue to do this until the skulls get him or he stops. He then scores for dice combinations, with a three-of-a-kind earning 100 points, a four-of-a-kind 200 points, and so on all the way up to an eight-of-a-kind earning 4,000 points. Each gold or diamond showing is worth 100 points on its own. A player earns a 500 point bonus if all eight dice score.\n\nIf a player rolls four or more skulls on his first roll, he heads to Skull Island for the turn, setting aside those skulls and continuing to roll as long as he sets aside at least one skull each time. Once he stops, all other players lose 100 points for each skull showing.\n\nBefore a player starts to roll for his turn, however, he draws a card from the pirate deck, which affects what's possible on that turn: He might score double for the treasure he collects, or need to roll sabers to fight off other pirates, or receive a free diamond or gold coin, or be able to score treasure even if he collect three skulls.\n\nOnce a player reaches 6,000 points, all other players take one final turn, then the player with the most points wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "235257", "name": "Piraten kapern: Sonderkarten"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 1071, "average": 6.39872, "bayesaverage": 5.84779, "stddev": 1.58379, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1846, "trading": 22, "wanting": 7, "wishing": 87, "numcomments": 183, "numweights": 64, "averageweight": 1.0781, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3237}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 907}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 25, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 17}, "2": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 12}}}, "usersrated": 1071.0, "average": 6.39872, "bayesaverage": 5.84779, "stddev": 1.58379, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1846.0, "trading": 22.0, "wanting": 7.0, "wishing": 87.0, "numcomments": 183.0, "numweights": 64.0, "averageweight": 1.0781, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3237}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 907}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "154753", "name": "Ice Cold Ice Hockey", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/euEb0pdD6jfGJSgb3JKaPA__thumb/img/4ysdn3sLDy7OQfP11-9eDPjqePU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1954979.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/euEb0pdD6jfGJSgb3JKaPA__original/img/w_l6SR1qIJzOBFRB3z28HS6zGhg=/0x0/pic1954979.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Cancelled Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Sports: Ice Hockey"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Print & Play", "Sports"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hand Management"], "designers": ["Andrew S.

An action deck of 64 cards, three rink-cards and comprehensive yet easy-to-understand rules comprise the complete game (although you'll need to supply a small token, disc or coin). The cards serve multiple purposes, including passing, skating, shooting, defense, shot-blocking and goaltending. Experienced players will be able to complete a game in about an hour.\n\nNote that this is NOT just a \u201cdraw and play cards (or a take-that!) game.\u201d Card combinations and good decisions are key in ICIH. You\u2019ll always want to keep an Inside Shot card in your hand, for example, in the hope of pairing it up with a Pass or Skate card that leads to an Inside Shot. (Your brain will be working on all cylinders during the entire game, and your play will improve over time as you learn to watch for the appearance of important cards.)\n\nI call the above a \u201cset-up.\u201d Three and even four-card set-ups are possible, and over time you\u2019ll learn what they are. You can also bluff a bit; for example, if you have a surplus of Offensive Zone (OZ) Skate or Pass cards but no Inside Shot card, you can play an OZ card which allows the play of a defensive card to tease one out of your opponent\u2019s hand.\n\nICIH features realistic shots on goal, scoring and game play. Sometimes you\u2019ll effortlessly set up end-to-end plays while at other times you\u2019ll only be able to dump the puck out of your own defensive zone. You\u2019ll shoot from the point and, after some effort, from close-in. On defense, sometimes you\u2019ll be able to challenge the puck-carrier and sometimes you won\u2019t. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to risk a penalty to stop an opponent\u2019s scoring chance. Loose pucks, blocked shots, breakaways, fighting, momentum, penalties, super-saves \u2013 they\u2019re all here in Ice Cold Ice Hockey!\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 50, "average": 5.1432, "bayesaverage": 5.48583, "stddev": 2.12136, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21, "trading": 0, "wanting": 1, "wishing": 9, "numcomments": 11, "numweights": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 17868}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}}}, "usersrated": 50.0, "average": 5.1432, "bayesaverage": 5.48583, "stddev": 2.12136, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 1.0, "wishing": 9.0, "numcomments": 11.0, "numweights": 2.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 17868}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "154809", "name": "Nippon", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DVJamHS1e24-scuM8aRH8g__thumb/img/GfDVi8Cdml30yla1ui0y3exXG7g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2683981.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DVJamHS1e24-scuM8aRH8g__original/img/ahJrNYlzr6vXXCnhmEuUoVuUAfQ=/0x0/pic2683981.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Country: Japan", "History: Industrial Revolution"], "categories": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Variable Phase Order"], "designers": ["Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro", "Paulo Soledade"], "artists": ["Mariano Iannelli"], "publishers": ["What's Your Game?", "Asmodee", "Ghenos Games", "hobbity.eu"], "description": "Japan during the Meiji period\u2014a closed, isolated, and feudal country\u2014decides to change into a modern industrialized state.

Because the grid on the board and the line counters are triangular, players have some real placement questions.\n\nThe game is very interactive, with players sometimes trying to cooperate and sometimes trying to stop other lines.

Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points.  Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent\u2019s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.\n\nThe game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings \u2013 or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.\n\nTash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.\n\nIn melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.\n\nWhat causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.\n\nWith multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.\n For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.\n\nFrom the publisher's website:\n\nDare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "169390", "name": "La Isla Prohibida: La Expansi\u00f3n Prohibida"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 41044, "average": 6.79404, "bayesaverage": 6.70107, "stddev": 1.19976, "median": 0.0, "owned": 70726, "trading": 2001, "wanting": 218, "wishing": 3733, "numcomments": 8006, "numweights": 1994, "averageweight": 1.7417, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 709}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 214}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 422, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 165, "not_recommended_rating": 143}, "2": {"best_rating": 71, "recommended_rating": 261, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "3": {"best_rating": 122, "recommended_rating": 228, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 268, "recommended_rating": 82, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "4+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 205}}}, "usersrated": 41044.0, "average": 6.79404, "bayesaverage": 6.70107, "stddev": 1.19976, "median": 0.0, "owned": 70726.0, "trading": 2001.0, "wanting": 218.0, "wishing": 3733.0, "numcomments": 8006.0, "numweights": 1994.0, "averageweight": 1.7417, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 709}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 214}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "140535", "name": "Kory\u014f", "alternative_names": ["Spiskowcy", "\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0451", "\uace0\ub824"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3Y2cUx6OlCqYl6A-JgZgeg__thumb/img/E_RIZMs_favAHVz78HTAfqom0hE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1858262.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3Y2cUx6OlCqYl6A-JgZgeg__original/img/kePUzMq2mhti3pDda3fyGuYVQ3A=/0x0/pic1858262.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Korea", "Theme: Steampunk"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": ["Cannon Buster", "Chos\u014fn", "NINE"], "mechanics": ["Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "designers": ["Gary Kim"], "artists": ["St\u00e9phane Gantiez", "Ian Parovel"], "publishers": ["Moonster Games", "2 Pionki", "Asmodee", "Hobby World", "Magpie (Korean Co)", "Portal Games"], "description": "Kory\u00c5\u008f is a game based on an uchronian and politico-steampunk universe.\n\nEach turn, players simultaneously choose a family of politician from their hand, and play as many cards of this family as they have and wish to.

You may patent brand-new parts in the Patent Office, look for rejected, volatile pieces of machinery in the chaos of the Junk Yard, try to gain an edge through the Back Alley, and finally build your prototype in the Workshop.

Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.\n\nLewis & Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new \"handbuilding\" mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.\n\nSince the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "164557", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Bauza & Cathala"}, {"id": "155402", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Benjamin Bord"}, {"id": "164554", "name": "Lewis & Clark: C\u00e9drick Chaboussit"}, {"id": "164556", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Martin Wallace"}, {"id": "314494", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Promo Cards"}, {"id": "164555", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Uwe Rosenberg"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 12654, "average": 7.49439, "bayesaverage": 7.26682, "stddev": 1.29016, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14993, "trading": 399, "wanting": 636, "wishing": 3401, "numcomments": 2318, "numweights": 657, "averageweight": 3.3425, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 197}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 141}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 272, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 106, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "2": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 144, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "3": {"best_rating": 162, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 111, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "5": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 49, "not_recommended_rating": 121}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 88}}}, "usersrated": 12654.0, "average": 7.49439, "bayesaverage": 7.26682, "stddev": 1.29016, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14993.0, "trading": 399.0, "wanting": 636.0, "wishing": 3401.0, "numcomments": 2318.0, "numweights": 657.0, "averageweight": 3.3425, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 197}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 141}], "game_family": "Lewis & Clark", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "137269", "name": "Spyrium", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ze4QFonaGDFj9QTapBQYlg__thumb/img/opVobJGfklKTacqs512ty9kq5QE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1808509.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ze4QFonaGDFj9QTapBQYlg__original/img/rGitckEaVK8dGWyM5kFcamV-ZG0=/0x0/pic1808509.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: England", "Series: Ystari originals", "Theme: Steampunk"], "categories": ["City Building", "Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Auction: Dutch Priority", "Events", "Income", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["William Attia"], "artists": ["Arnaud Demaegd", "Neriac"], "publishers": ["Ystari Games", "Asmodee"], "description": "Spyrium is set in an alternate world, an England set in a steampunk-based universe.

Compare the number of tricks that each player has won in this round and subtract the lowest score from the highest one (for instance, if Dr. Jekyll won 6 tricks and Mr. Hyde won 4 tricks, then the final result is 6-4=2). This result indicates by how many spaces the Identity Marker will move to Mr. Hyde's side.  \nEvil is relentless! Even if Dr. Jekyll won more tricks that Mr. Hyde, the marker will progress towards Mr. Hyde's side. As Dr. Jekyll, your goal is to keep balance, without giving in to darkness!\n\nIf the marker reaches the last space of the track (far left), then Mr. Hyde instantly wins the game. Otherwise, start a new round: remove the three colored tokens from the board and reshuffle all cards, including the 5 cards that you set aside at the beginning of this round.\n\nMr. Hyde wins as soon as the Identity Marker reaches the last space of the Identity Track (far left).

Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety.

You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team.\u00a0\nYou can also set up a tent and wait for better weather.

The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers.

In addition, you place three technology tiles at random on the tan, orange and violet sections of the tech chart and six random tiles on the brown section; the tech tiles show 1-5 arrows. You also shuffle tan, orange and violet decks of cards and place them in the appropriate places. Tan cards provide an one-shot effect, orange cards give you a permanent power, and violet cards present you with an objective you must meet; if you do so, you can play the objective card on your turn, and immediately draw another. You can play at most one card of each color each turn.\n\nOn a turn, a player takes one of three actions:\n\n\n    Place a new piece on a region of the game board, with this piece sharing two of the three characteristics of a piece in a neighboring region; the new piece cannot be shorter than the original piece. Mark this piece with a token of your player color.\n    Move one of your pieces on the board to an empty region, with short pieces moving only one space, medium height pieces moving up to two spaces, and tall pieces up to three.\n    Take over a region controlled by an opponent by moving one of your pieces into this region and relocating the opponent's piece to the region your piece left. You can do this only if the attacking piece is thicker than the opponent's piece.\n\n\nWhen you place a new piece on the board or move an existing piece, you're rewarded based on the color of the space you occupy. If you place in or move into a tan, orange or violet region, either you take a tile and the top card of this color or you draw three cards of this color and keep one of them. For a brown region, you either draw two tiles from the brown section of the tech board or draw one tile from anywhere. The technology tiles must be acquired from low to high \u2013 so you can't acquire a 4 unless you have a 3 \u2013 but you can have multiple tech stacks. You must meet a certain technology threshold in order to play the orange cards and acquire their special power.\n\nIn addition, you can score points during the game by occupying a grassland on a continent or the two regions on opposite sides of a waterway strait.\n\nPlayers take turns until either all of the pieces are on the game board or all the tiles have been acquired or all the cards of one color have been drawn. Once this happens, players tally their points for objectives, grasslands, straits, tech tiles, and cards still in hand to see who wins!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "150098", "name": "Origin: Ranger Die"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 1073, "average": 6.69193, "bayesaverage": 5.98849, "stddev": 1.16678, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1837, "trading": 101, "wanting": 55, "wishing": 306, "numcomments": 300, "numweights": 51, "averageweight": 2.1373, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2451}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1120}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 674}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 18, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 5}}}, "usersrated": 1073.0, "average": 6.69193, "bayesaverage": 5.98849, "stddev": 1.16678, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1837.0, "trading": 101.0, "wanting": 55.0, "wishing": 306.0, "numcomments": 300.0, "numweights": 51.0, "averageweight": 2.1373, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2451}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1120}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 674}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "127304", "name": "Herooj", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/86WgnBKhbIzDNQvnBR69BA__thumb/img/Fs0D6zoorKf6u6QuAlagaPyws9M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5760650.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/86WgnBKhbIzDNQvnBR69BA__original/img/-zFQDDbfXav-q1z9cIoTcQwBIG4=/0x0/pic5760650.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Point to Point Movement"], "designers": ["David Crespo"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["(Unknown)"], "description": "HEROOJ (heroes, in esperanto language) is an abstract board game for 2 players, which can be played on an 8x8 board, with 10 pawns (double-sided pieces) and 4 masters for each player.

Points can also be gained from building your palace and controlling the temples.

If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.  Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.  A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.\nThis game, also known as Draughts, is part of the Checkers family.\n\nThe Official Checker Board to be used in tournaments and official matches of associations like international WCDF, ACF, and APCA usually shall be colored of green and off-white (buff).

Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories.  Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc.  Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible.  When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.\n\nThe traditional (public domain) game Yacht predates the trademarked game, and has slightly different scoring.\n\nThere are four basic scoring difference between the tradition game Yacht and Yahtzee.  They are:  1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2) there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is scored as the sum of the dice.  The other scoring rules are identical between the two games.\n\nTravel versions of the game use a device that keeps the dice captured within compartments of a plastic box and allows players to \"lock\" a particular die between rolls.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1956, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 10, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 6, "stats": {"usersrated": 11506, "average": 5.38585, "bayesaverage": 5.3506, "stddev": 1.55055, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19896, "trading": 201, "wanting": 27, "wishing": 208, "numcomments": 3014, "numweights": 779, "averageweight": 1.1926, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 19782}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 2076}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 108, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 26, "not_recommended_rating": 44}, "2": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 52, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "3": {"best_rating": 55, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 55, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "5": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 51, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "6": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "7": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "8": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 60}, "9": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 64}, "10": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 64}, "10+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 58}}}, "usersrated": 11506.0, "average": 5.38585, "bayesaverage": 5.3506, "stddev": 1.55055, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19896.0, "trading": 201.0, "wanting": 27.0, "wishing": 208.0, "numcomments": 3014.0, "numweights": 779.0, "averageweight": 1.1926, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 19782}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 2076}], "game_family": "Yahtzee", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "2389", "name": "Othello", "alternative_names": ["Annex", "Annexation", "Chain Reaction", "Dominans", "Einstein Mania", "Ex-it", "G\u00f6rgi", "Heimlich, Still & Leise", "Kipp Ihn!", "Las Vegas Backfire", "Magnetic Othello + Chess", "Magnetic Reversi", "Master Othello", "Moros y Cristianos", "Occur", "Original Reversi", "Othello Classic", "Othello Original", "Othello Reversi", "Over-She-Goes", "\u00d3\u00feell\u00f3", "Ping Guo Qi (Apple Chess)", "Pocket Othello", "Preto No Branco", "Reverschip", "Reversi", "Reversi & Othello", "Reversi Interessantes Brett-Spiel", "Reversi Junior", "Reversi Magnetic Game", "Reversible Game", "Sogo/Reversi", "Takeover", "Turnemova", "Turnover", "White & Black", "Y\u00f6 ja P\u00e4iv\u00e4", "\u0420\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438", "\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9", "\u30aa\u30bb\u30ed", "\u6e90\u5e73\u7881", "\u7d93\u5178\u9ed1\u767d\u68cb", "\u9ed1\u767d\u68cb"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b0M435GTcUIJgcZ-vwDmCQ__thumb/img/KKuN6RMsa4sTLj3wNhOg4EBrU0Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic243834.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b0M435GTcUIJgcZ-vwDmCQ__original/img/OUtNwqIq2aO6rpySfJCOHPazmmU=/0x0/pic243834.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Series: Traveller (Ravensburger)", "Series: Unser Lieblingsspiel (Georg Appl / Espenlaub)", "TV Shows: The Simpsons"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": ["Junior Othello"], "mechanics": ["Enclosure", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["John W.

Translated loosely as \"elephant game\", the name of XiangQi may have first been recorded in Songs of Chu during the 4th century BC of early China; in the state of Qi during the Warring State Period, the name \"XiangQi\" meant ivory Liubo pieces, not modern XiangQi played by Chinese. The modern Xiangqi set dates back to the Tang dynasty.\n\nBased closely on ancient Chinese military strategy, XiangQi draws comparisons to European Chess, and indeed, both are descended from the ancient Indian game of Chaturanga.\n\n---\n\nXiangQi, commonly referred to in English as \"Chinese Chess\", is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a board that is 9 lines wide and 10 lines long. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.\n\nThe pieces on both sides and their movements & special rules are:\n\n\n    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to \u2018see\u2019 the enemy General on an open file.\n    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.\n    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.\n    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot. To capture, it must first leap over an intervening piece of either color.\n    2 Horses: 1 point orthogonally, then one point diagonally.\n    2 Elephants / Ministers: 2 points diagonally. Cannot cross the river.\n    5 Soldiers: 1 point straight forward.  Once across the river, can also move 1 point sideways instead.\n\n\nPieces capture as they move and never jump. The only exception (for both rules) apply to the cannon.\n\n---\n\nThe price of the game varies depending on the material used in the game. Inexpensive sets are usually made with plastic or low-grade wooden pieces and a paper gameboard. Expensive sets are usually made with jade or high-grade wooden pieces and a wooden gameboard.\n\nVariants\n\n    Banqi - Game using same pieces\n    Giog - Game using same pieces\n    Mini Xiang Qi - Smaller version\n    San Guo Qi - Three-player version\n    Qi Guo Xiang Qi - Seven-player version\n    Changgi - Korean version\n\n\n\n\nYou can play Chinese Chess for free at http://www.xiangqi.com.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 762, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 1854, "average": 7.13126, "bayesaverage": 6.32709, "stddev": 1.54881, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2833, "trading": 63, "wanting": 48, "wishing": 290, "numcomments": 595, "numweights": 188, "averageweight": 3.5957, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1342}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 47}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 24, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "2": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 17}}}, "usersrated": 1854.0, "average": 7.13126, "bayesaverage": 6.32709, "stddev": 1.54881, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2833.0, "trading": 63.0, "wanting": 48.0, "wishing": 290.0, "numcomments": 595.0, "numweights": 188.0, "averageweight": 3.5957, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1342}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 47}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "2397", "name": "Backgammon", "alternative_names": ["Acey-Deucy  (variation)", "Aqua Player Floating Backgammon", "Austin Powers's Backgammon", "Back-Gammon", "Backgammon - Tric Trac", "Backgammon / Jacquet", "Backgammon and Acey-Deucey", "Backgammon and Acey-Deucy", "Backgammon B.C.", "Backgammon Exclusive", "Backgammon for Juniors", "Backgammon on a Keychain", "Backgammon School", "Backgammon Set", "Backgammon Teacher", "Backgammon Tutor", "Backgammon: The Ancient Game of Cunning Strategy", "Backgammoneasy", "Br\u00e4de Backgammon", "Br\u00e4dspel", "Deluxe Backgammon", "Folding Backgammon", "Gam\u00e3o", "Jeu de Jacquet et Backgammon", "Juego de Backgammon", "Kotra", "The Lord of the Rings Backgammon", "Magnetic Backgammon", "Magnetic Travel Backgammon", "Master Backgammon", "Nardshir", "Novelty Corp", "Ost\u00e1bla", "Pack-gammon", "Pocket Backgammon", "Pocket Magnetic Backgammon", "Puff", "Puzzle Backgammon", "Revertier", "Sensory Backgammon Computer", "Sheshbesh", "Table", "Taplas", "Tavla", "Tavli", "Tavola Reale", "Toc", "Toccategli", "Tockadill", "Tournament Backgammon", "Travel Backgammon", "Tric Trac", "Tric Trac Backgammon", "Tryktrak", "De Winnende Combinatie", "Wurfzabel", "\u03a4\u03ac\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9", "\u041d\u0430\u0440\u0434\u044b", "\u0422\u0440\u0438\u043a-\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a", "\u0428\u0435\u0448-\u0431\u0435\u0448", "\u05e9\u05e9-\u05d1\u05e9", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30ae\u30e3\u30e2\u30f3", "\u53cc\u9646\u68cb", "\u96d9\u9678\u68cb", "\ubc31\uac1c\uba3c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_6HVCuGni6NunlrSje0ySQ__thumb/img/FS7YID4DgqMBppP0nhyG52MP7Xk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1361122.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_6HVCuGni6NunlrSje0ySQ__original/img/xAF3cm3sKRHjIDTlfJyKNdZKI7c=/0x0/pic1361122.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Movies: Austin Powers", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Promotional: Promo Board Games", "Series: 3M Bookshelf Series", "Series: Casino Serie (Ravensburger)", "Series: Classic (Schmidt Spiele)", "Series: GoPlay", "Series: Taschen-Spiele (Heyne)", "Traditional Games: Backgammon"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Advantage Token", "Betting and Bluffing", "Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Track Movement"], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "artists": ["(Uncredited)", "Willem Cornelisz Duyster"], "publishers": ["(Public Domain)", "(Unknown)", "3M", "ABRA", "Alga", "Ariel Productions Ltd", "Arrow Games Ltd", "ASS Altenburger Spielkarten", "Basic Fun, Inc.", "Bello Games New York, Inc.", "Berliner Spielkarten", "Bisonte", "Blatz", "Brio AB", "B\u00fctehorn Spiele (Buchholz Verlag)", "Cardinal", "Carlit", "Cathay", "Cayro, the games", "Chad Valley Co Ltd.", "Chadwick Miller Inc.", "Challenge Master Game Co Ltd", "CHH Games", "Classic Toys", "Creative Crafthouse", "Crisloid", "Croner", "Daells Varehus", "Dal Negro", "Deuce", "Dilemma Games", "Dino Toys s. r. o.", "Diset S.

Each player has a set of 15 \"men\" that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of his men to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's men, forcing the captured men to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 men off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the \"doubling cube\", which allows players to up the stakes of the game, as it is often played for money. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll as well as measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.\n\nBackgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920's, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.\n\nThe names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means \"Battle on Wood\". In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat.

It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.\n\nIn the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.\n\nNext, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.\n\nThe origin date listed for this game is approximate.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "72677", "name": "Mastermind Ultimate Cribbage"}, {"id": "6357", "name": "Wild: Cribbage Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1630, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 8100, "average": 7.05784, "bayesaverage": 6.77936, "stddev": 1.56955, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12120, "trading": 56, "wanting": 16, "wishing": 249, "numcomments": 2129, "numweights": 527, "averageweight": 1.9013, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 605}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 50}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 153}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 120, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 81}, "2": {"best_rating": 107, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 64, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "4": {"best_rating": 19, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 70}}}, "usersrated": 8100.0, "average": 7.05784, "bayesaverage": 6.77936, "stddev": 1.56955, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12120.0, "trading": 56.0, "wanting": 16.0, "wishing": 249.0, "numcomments": 2129.0, "numweights": 527.0, "averageweight": 1.9013, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 605}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 50}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 153}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "2399", "name": "Senet", "alternative_names": ["30 Squares", "30 Stufen", "Die 30 Stufen", "The Ancient Game of Senet", "Fara\u00f3n", "JAM!", "King Tut's Game", "Passing Through The Netherworld", "Sechet-Senet", "Senat", "Seneto (alternate)", "Szenet (alternate)", "\u0421\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0442 (alternate)", "\uc138\ub124\ud2b8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-bXCHh7tU1kCklqY_DyqDQ__thumb/img/peDDR6GUgYi5X4D5vdY0A2ZqBt0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic361022.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-bXCHh7tU1kCklqY_DyqDQ__original/img/K2zYXazffPFz0zc3hjv6LZpo6CA=/0x0/pic361022.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Continents: Africa", "Country: Egypt", "Historical Figures: King Tutankhamun (King Tut)", "Traditional Games: Backgammon"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Religious"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "artists": ["Johan Andreasson", "Elizabeth Carpenter", "Helen Ward"], "publishers": ["(Public Domain)", "(Self-Published)", "ABRA", "Cadaco", "Candlewick Press", "Copp Clark Publishing Company", "Fundex", "Geoludie", "HABA", "Hawthorn Games", "Joen", "Juegos Crone", "The Kirk Game Company Inc", "Krealudik", "L.

Each player has 5 pawns which travel around a 3 by 10 board in an S shaped path.  Movement is dictated by the throw of 4 sticks (black on one side and white on the other) which can produce a 1,2,3,4, or 6, (5 is not possible) depending on how they land..  As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one's pawns off first.  A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board.  Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest of man's games but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.  Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground.  As a result modern man has made several educated guesses as to the rules.  The most popular versions are in the files section.\n\nIt may be a relative of Aseb and The Royal Game of Ur.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "143036", "name": "Senet Cardgame"}], "expands": [],

The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.\n\nEach player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by \"Hit!\" or \"Miss!\".  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.\n\nThe Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots. Destroyer: 3 Shots, Etc.).\n\nIn 2008, Hasbro \"reinvented\" the game into Battleship (Revised).\n\nSome history of the published versions of the game:\n1931: Starex Novelty Co. of NY publishes Salvo.\n1933: The Strathmore Co. publishes Combat, The Battleship Game.\n1943: Milton Bradley publishes the pad-and-pencil game Broadsides, The Game of Naval Strategy.\n1943: Also published in 1943 Sink it by the L R Gebert Co. for distribution by G. Krueger Brewing Co.\n1940's: Maurice L. Freedman Co. of RI publishes Warfare Naval Combat.\n1961: Ideal publishes Salvo.\n\nOther titles over the years have included Swiss Navy, Sunk (Parker Bros.), Convoy (Transogram), Wings (Strategy Games Co. of California), and Naval Battle (3M Paper and Pencil Version) .\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "165274", "name": "Super Sea Battle"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1931, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 8320, "average": 4.63557, "bayesaverage": 4.70945, "stddev": 1.50766, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12691, "trading": 229, "wanting": 8, "wishing": 104, "numcomments": 2296, "numweights": 623, "averageweight": 1.2231, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 19924}, {"id": "4665", "name": "childrensgames", "friendlyname": "Children's Game Rank", "value": 802}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 92, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 74}, "2": {"best_rating": 90, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 72}}}, "usersrated": 8320.0, "average": 4.63557, "bayesaverage": 4.70945, "stddev": 1.50766, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12691.0, "trading": 229.0, "wanting": 8.0, "wishing": 104.0, "numcomments": 2296.0, "numweights": 623.0, "averageweight": 1.2231, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 19924}, {"id": "4665", "name": "childrensgames", "friendlyname": "Children's Game Rank", "value": 802}], "game_family": "Battleship", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "2448", "name": "Kalah", "alternative_names": ["Arcana", "Aw\u00e9l\u00e9", "Badari", "Bantumi", "Carcara", "Classic Mancala", "Conference", "Congkak", "Congklak", "Folding Mancala The African Stone Game", "Kalaha", "Kalaha Spel", "Kalahar", "Kalahr", "Mancala", "Mancala for Kids", "The Mancala Game", "Mancala Junior", "Mandinka", "Mankala", "Maya 6x6", "Mop-up", "Parlor Mancala", "Sabo", "Sahara", "Serata", "Sungka", "Teddy", "Travel Mancala", "\u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1", "\u30de\u30f3\u30ab\u30e9", "\ub9cc\uce7c\ub77c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XmC3SnD_g_b6BC_6lthVlQ__thumb/img/8FIpgdH96zPFuXzLjAZQkWT7dnk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1274349.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XmC3SnD_g_b6BC_6lthVlQ__original/img/PhTRgPh-gKWABgGG00TZjRUOvPg=/0x0/pic1274349.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Traditional Games: Mancala", "Category: Combinatorial", "Continents: Africa", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Promotional: Promo Board Games"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Mancala"], "designers": ["William Julius Champion Jr."], "artists": ["(Uncredited)", "Frank Gerwin"], "publishers": ["(Public Domain)", "(Unknown)", "ABRA", "Adrenaline Brush Ltd", "Alga", "ASS Altenburger Spielkarten", "Barnes & Noble", "Bohemia", "Brain Games Germany", "Brio AB", "Brookstone", "The Canadian Group", "Cardinal", "Carrom Art", "Cayro, the games", "CHH Games", "Classic Games", "Creative Crafthouse", "Cylinder Games", "Daddy-O Productions", "danspil", "DeAgostini", "Dilemma Games", "Domino-Verlag", "Dujardin", "E.S.

The rows have a large store at either end called kalah. \nA player owns the six pits closest to him and the kalah on his right side. \nBeginners may start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game becomes more and more challenging by starting with 4, 5 or up to 6 seeds in each pit. Today, 4 seeds per pit has become the most common variant, but Champion recommended the expert game with 6.\n\nA player takes all the seeds from one of his pits, they are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the players own kalah, but not into the opponent's store.\n\nIf the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured.\nIf the last seed falls into the player's kalah, he must move again.\nIf the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, he captures all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in his kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.\n\nThe game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of his holes. The remaining pieces are captured by his adversary. The player who has captured most pieces is declared the winner.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "44842", "name": "10 Mighty Men"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 700, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 10, "minplaytime": 10, "maxplaytime": 10, "minage": 5, "stats": {"usersrated": 5784, "average": 5.91499, "bayesaverage": 5.78831, "stddev": 1.42667, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10737, "trading": 130, "wanting": 10, "wishing": 184, "numcomments": 1603, "numweights": 421, "averageweight": 1.6247, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3715}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 413}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 51, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 39}, "2": {"best_rating": 46, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 37}}}, "usersrated": 5784.0, "average": 5.91499, "bayesaverage": 5.78831, "stddev": 1.42667, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10737.0, "trading": 130.0, "wanting": 10.0, "wishing": 184.0, "numcomments": 1603.0, "numweights": 421.0, "averageweight": 1.6247, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3715}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 413}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "173346", "name": "7 Wonders Duel", "alternative_names": ["7 Csoda P\u00e1rbaj", "7 Cud\u00f3w \u015awiata: Pojedynek", "7 Div\u016f sv\u011bta: Duel", "7 \u0427\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441: \u0414\u0443\u044d\u043b\u044c", "7 \u0e2a\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e28\u0e08\u0e23\u0e23\u0e22\u0e4c \u0e14\u0e27\u0e25", "7 \uc6d0\ub354\uc2a4 \ub300\uacb0", "\u4e03\u5927\u5947\u8e5f \u5c0d\u6c7a", "\u4e03\u5927\u5947\u8ff9:\u5bf9\u51b3", "\u4e03\u5927\u5bf9\u51b3", "\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u4e03\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70:\u30c7\u30e5\u30a8\u30eb"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WzNs1mA_o22ZWTR8fkLP2g__thumb/img/qGf8-LJx4lsNOgpjS6iCs2TyKts=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3376065.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WzNs1mA_o22ZWTR8fkLP2g__original/img/M6wL1YFgW-PsdtJ328m2QiJf1K8=/0x0/pic3376065.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: 7 Wonders", "Game: 7 Wonders Duel", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Versions & Editions: Two-Player Versions of More-Player Games"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "City Building", "Civilization"], "implementations": ["7 Wonders"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Drafting", "Set Collection", "Sudden Death Ending", "Tug of War"], "designers": ["Antoine Bauza", "Bruno Cathala"], "artists": ["Miguel Coimbra"], "publishers": ["Repos Production", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asterion Press", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Ludicus", "Ponva d.o.o.", "Pridemage Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Siam Board Games", "Sombreros Production"], "description": "In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.\n\nWhat's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.\n\nEach player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.\n\nPlayers can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.\n\nA player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "309116", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: Agora"}, {"id": "202976", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon"}, {"id": "310215", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: Solo"}, {"id": "196339", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: Statue of Liberty"}, {"id": "186069", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: The Messe Essen Promo Card"}, {"id": "274383", "name": "Leaders (fan expansion for 7 Wonders Duel)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 57187, "average": 8.10373, "bayesaverage": 7.97823, "stddev": 1.17587, "median": 0.0, "owned": 88995, "trading": 597, "wanting": 958, "wishing": 7815, "numcomments": 7948, "numweights": 1766, "averageweight": 2.2203, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 17}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 18}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 737, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 539}, "2": {"best_rating": 709, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 553}}}, "usersrated": 57187.0, "average": 8.10373, "bayesaverage": 7.97823, "stddev": 1.17587, "median": 0.0, "owned": 88995.0, "trading": 597.0, "wanting": 958.0, "wishing": 7815.0, "numcomments": 7948.0, "numweights": 1766.0, "averageweight": 2.2203, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 17}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 18}], "game_family": "7 Wonders", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "226254", "name": "The Ruhr: A Story of Coal Trade", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RBJXwnUFxof9hJMSbwmfKw__thumb/img/zT3CPee2AvTakMfARlfZhtw7oDk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3538036.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RBJXwnUFxof9hJMSbwmfKw__original/img/NBrdp2B6xVaBG_oR-VSM5KaqR5Q=/0x0/pic3538036.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Series: Coal (Thomas Spitzer)"], "categories": ["Economic", "Environmental", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Nautical", "Transportation"], "implementations": ["Ruhrschifffahrt 1769-1890"], "mechanics": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Thomas Spitzer"], "artists": ["Harald Lieske"], "publishers": ["Capstone Games"], "description": "In The Ruhr: A Story of Coal Trade, the second game of Thomas Spitzer's historic coal trilogy, you are transported to the Ruhr region in the 18th century, at the beginning of the industrial revolution. Coal, after being discovered in Haspelknecht, is in high demand as cities and factories throughout the region are in need of this coveted resource. The Ruhr river presented a convenient route of transportation from the coal mines. However, the Ruhr was filled with obstacles and large dams, making it incredibly difficult to navigate. Trade coal for valuable upgrades and plan your route to victory along the Ruhr!\n\nIn more detail, the players transport and sell coal to cities and factories along the Ruhr river in the 18th and 19th centuries. By selling coal to cities and factories, players acquire unique progress markers. In the beginning, players have access only to low value coal. By selling coal to certain locations, players gain access to high value coal. In addition to selling coal, the players build warehouses, build locks, and export coal to neighboring countries in the pursuit of the most victory points.\n\nThis game, an updated version of Ruhrschifffahrt 1769-1890, includes the standalone expansion The Ohio: 1811-1861. In this game, players transport and trade goods along the Ohio River during a time when Ohio was granted statehood and became heavily populated as its industries flourished. The Ohio is played in a manner similar to The Ruhr, but with new and additional elements.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 454, "average": 6.96696, "bayesaverage": 5.84255, "stddev": 1.32726, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1206, "trading": 58, "wanting": 78, "wishing": 273, "numcomments": 144, "numweights": 14, "averageweight": 3.5714, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3277}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 7, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}}}, "usersrated": 454.0, "average": 6.96696, "bayesaverage": 5.84255, "stddev": 1.32726, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1206.0, "trading": 58.0, "wanting": 78.0, "wishing": 273.0, "numcomments": 144.0, "numweights": 14.0, "averageweight": 3.5714, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3277}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "62809", "name": "Jump Gate", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ftSPk96cwHyiiZkyEO5NIw__thumb/img/0rrEJkbVDZBnU8RDsvJWP5ksgIE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic864385.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ftSPk96cwHyiiZkyEO5NIw__original/img/FaJLPHe1OFRJseqCx5T4RXyapbk=/0x0/pic864385.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Card Game", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "implementations": ["Space Mission"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Matt Worden"], "artists": ["Josh Cappel", "Ariel Seoane", "Gary Simpson", "Scott Slomiany", "Matt Worden"], "publishers": ["The Game Crafter, LLC", "Matt Worden Games"], "description": "Explore far-away planets.  Discover what resources and surprises they hold. Be the first to set foot on a new planet and claim it as your own. Collect resources to gain fortune and fame. All of this comes courtesy of: the Jump Gate.\n\nPlayers are spaceship captains that are competing to be the best at claiming new planets and collecting the resources found at those planets.  Points are scored at the end of the game based on the number of planets they scanned and claimed, and their combination of resources collected.  Each type of resource has a different method for being scored -- so, collecting sets of the same resource is encouraged ... and disrupting other players\u2019 collection plans is good strategy.\n\nGameplay Summary (1st & 2nd Editions)\nEight planets are set in a circle around the Jump Gate and Black Hole Boards.  Resource cards are distributed:  1 face-up to each player, 1 face-up to each planet, and the rest are distributed face-down amongst the planets.\n\nPlayers are each given 5 NavComp cards and the rest of the NavComp cards are set as a draw deck in the middle of the table.  Each NavComp card contains 2 codes (used to take some of the standard actions) and possibly a special action.\n\nPlayers take turns around the table.  On a player's turn, he/she takes 2 actions in any order, and may select from the following actions:  Research (refill hand), Fly (move to neighboring planet), Jump (use the Jump Gate to move to another Planet), Scan (reveal a resource at a planet), Land & Claim (claim a planet and reveal all resources there), Harvest (collect a resource), and Special Action.  Special actions include being able to scan a far-away planet, harvest extra resources, swap locations with another player, etc.\n\nWhen players \"Jump\", they add one of their markers to the Jump Gate Board.  The player with the most markers on the Jump Gate Board at the end of the game gains an extra 5 points.  If a player collects a Resource that has a \"Black Hole\" icon on it, a marker is added to the Black Hole Board.  If too many markers get added to that board, the game ends and the player with the most markers on the Black Hole Board loses some of his/her collected Resources.  The game can also end when all non-Black-Hole Resources have been collected from all of the planets.\n\nScoring is done at the end of the game, and players are awarded points for Scanning and Claiming Planets, as well as for the combination of Resources they had collected.  Each type of Resource has a different method for scoring -- but all encourage a player to collect as much of that Resource as possible.  The player with the most total points is the winner.\n\n3rd Edition Gameplay Changes\nThe 3rd Edition, published in a smaller box with artwork and player component updates, also included a number of design changes:\n\n    Max. Players is reduced to 5\n    New \"Sand\" resource replaces the \"Nothing\" cards from earlier editions\n    Setup changes include giving players two or three hidden resource cards (as opposed to a single face-up card) and not every resource getting used in the game\n    In-game changes include cleaner, more thematic scanning and harvesting rules\n    The Black Hole only has 7 marker spaces on it, and triggering the end game via the Black Hole results in the player with the most markers on the Black Hole losing their hidden resources they received during setup instead of randomly-chosen resources\n    No points are scored for scanning or the Jump Gate ... only the resources collected and Planets claimed\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 171, "average": 6.17418, "bayesaverage": 5.56993, "stddev": 1.38294, "median": 0.0, "owned": 239, "trading": 20, "wanting": 11, "wishing": 86, "numcomments": 61, "numweights": 12, "averageweight": 2.25, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 8431}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 1617}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 4, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}}}, "usersrated": 171.0, "average": 6.17418, "bayesaverage": 5.56993, "stddev": 1.38294, "median": 0.0, "owned": 239.0, "trading": 20.0, "wanting": 11.0, "wishing": 86.0, "numcomments": 61.0, "numweights": 12.0, "averageweight": 2.25, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 8431}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 1617}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "24508", "name": "Taluva", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PC01tlKF5hf3et7F3mtHtw__thumb/img/e2-h91qjH6nNLby7xn-T_ohmVaA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1948254.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PC01tlKF5hf3et7F3mtHtw__original/img/jMTsoBodWAAnxEXEbk9lolz00AI=/0x0/pic1948254.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: 3-Dimensional (3D)", "Region: Oceania", "Theme: Tropical", "Theme: Tropical Islands"], "categories": ["City Building", "Territory Building"], "implementations": ["Taluva Deluxe"], "mechanics": ["Modular Board", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Marcel-Andr\u00e9 Casasola Merkle"], "artists": ["Manuel Casasola Merkle", "Xavier Gueniffey Durin", "Julien Le Faucheur", "Marcel-Andr\u00e9 Casasola Merkle"], "publishers": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "Cranio Creations", "Ferti", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.\n\nEach turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.\nNext, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.\n\nThe game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.\n\nA lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "235255", "name": "Taluva Extension"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2006, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 7703, "average": 7.17169, "bayesaverage": 6.87542, "stddev": 1.27584, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7723, "trading": 151, "wanting": 549, "wishing": 2132, "numcomments": 2001, "numweights": 677, "averageweight": 2.2718, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 498}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 25}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 313}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 181, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 86}, "2": {"best_rating": 94, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 17}, "3": {"best_rating": 61, "recommended_rating": 86, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4": {"best_rating": 48, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 69}}}, "usersrated": 7703.0, "average": 7.17169, "bayesaverage": 6.87542, "stddev": 1.27584, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7723.0, "trading": 151.0, "wanting": 549.0, "wishing": 2132.0, "numcomments": 2001.0, "numweights": 677.0, "averageweight": 2.2718, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 498}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 25}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 313}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "94891", "name": "Kabaleo", "alternative_names": ["\u05e7\u05d1\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qbwd_cGNdXFoaBjLKmr6MQ__thumb/img/V6ttr9TtX9mjE9jJneTQvpgvaW0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic947749.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qbwd_cGNdXFoaBjLKmr6MQ__original/img/3D2PHcgHsAEMNSnzDhJDFv62u4U=/0x0/pic947749.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Bluffing", "Deduction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Jean-Luc Renaud"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["FoxMind", "Gigamic"], "description": "In Kabaleo each player has a secret color of pyramids \u2013 but with six colors in the game, at least two colors won't be owned by any player.

It\u2019s played on the squares of a 10x10 square board, which is initially empty. Apart from the board, the necessary material comprises seven shooters and a sufficient number of black and white stones.\n\nBoth players control a number of neutral red pieces and shoot stones of their own colour from them. In order to win, a player must claim a majority of neutral pieces by having them surrounded by larger groups of their own pieces than their opponent's.\n\nThis game won (along with Four) the BoardGameGeek Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game of 2013 Award.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions\n\nA piece is a shooter, a black stone or a white stone.\n\nA group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. The size of a group is the number of stones in it. Stones on top of shooters aren't part of any groups.\n\nA trapped shooter is a shooter that can\u2019t make any legal move in the current position.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlay\n\nThe board starts out empty. Black starts the game by placing three shooters on empty squares of the board, and then White places the remaining four in the same fashion. In both cases, no shooters can be placed orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any other. This restriction doesn\u2019t apply to the rest of the game.\n\nFrom then on, the players take turns, starting with Black. On his turn, a player can (but is not obliged to) move a shooter to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any other pieces. Then, the player must place a stone of his color on an empty square which is on the same straight orthogonal or diagonal line as the destination square of the moved shooter (or any shooter, if none was moved), with no other pieces in between along that line. This is called shooting. Claimed shooters (see below) can\u2019t move or shoot.\n\nAt this moment, if there are any trapped shooters on the board that haven\u2019t been claimed before, each one of them is claimed by the player who owns the biggest group orthogonally adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of each color are the same size, the shooter is claimed by the opponent. Claiming a shooter is indicated by placing a stone of the corresponding color on top of it. Claimed shooters remain unchanged for the rest of the game.\n\nThe game ends when a player has claimed the majority of shooters, i.e. at least four of them. That player wins. Draws are not possible.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSmaller versions\n\nFor shorter but still reasonable games, the following variants are suggested:\n\n\n     7x7 board with three shooters. Black places one shooter on his first turn, and White places the other two. Whoever claims two shooters wins.\n\n\n\n     9x9 board with five shooters. Black places two shooters on his first turn, and White places the other three. Whoever claims three shooters wins.\n\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     Board Game Arena (real-time, turn-based)\n     Boardspace.net (real-time, AI option)\n\n\nMobile Apps\n\n     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS\n     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 5, "stats": {"usersrated": 62, "average": 6.61452, "bayesaverage": 5.54124, "stddev": 1.58825, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29, "trading": 0, "wanting": 4, "wishing": 36, "numcomments": 24, "numweights": 3, "averageweight": 2.3333, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 10707}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 455}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 3, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}}}, "usersrated": 62.0, "average": 6.61452, "bayesaverage": 5.54124, "stddev": 1.58825, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 4.0, "wishing": 36.0, "numcomments": 24.0, "numweights": 3.0, "averageweight": 2.3333, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 10707}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 455}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "210008", "name": "Off the Rails", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ELtb1dY7laxIIX_CuPElMg__thumb/img/KRxuDrd5qKEdAgvjyqe1idDhdaY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3427538.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ELtb1dY7laxIIX_CuPElMg__original/img/6cGjJPy2yZuR6L6p_OZJt_flJ0g=/0x0/pic3427538.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Maze", "Puzzle", "Racing", "Transportation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Grid Movement", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Push Your Luck", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Andrew Platt", "Stuart Platt"], "artists": ["Andrew Platt"], "publishers": ["Rotten Games"], "description": "Off the Rails is a strategic, competitive, tile placement, roller-coaster of a board game for 1-4 players recommended for ages 12+.

Over the next 60 years Chicago experienced an economic golden age, making such great progress that it hosted The World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, followed not long after by a celebration of its Century of Progress at The World's Fair in 1933.\n\nMany of the household brands we've come to know and love today had their start in Chicago during this time period; Oscar Mayer, Kraft, Quaker Oats, Nabisco, Swift & Co, Armour & Co, Schwinn Bicycles, Charles Schwab, and many others made a home here in this tall, bold slugger.\n\nIn City of the Big Shoulders players take on the roles of entrepreneurs and investors seeking to rebuild Chicago into a city fit for the world stage. In this unique merger of 18xx-style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire employees, equip their factories, produce goods and sell them to be delivered to homes across the midwest.\n\nAlthough City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of strategic depth and rewarding gameplay, it does so in a shorter timeline than is typical of most heavy economic games. Players play just five rounds (also known as decades) in about two and a half hours. Each decade consists of five unique phases: A stock phase where players can buy and sell stock; a building phase where players rebuild the city of Chicago, placing action spaces on the board; an action phase where companies send their partners to make deals across Chicago; an Operating Phase where companies buy resources, produce goods, and ship them out of Chicago; and finally a cleanup phase where the board is set up for the following decade. At the end of the fifth decade, the game ends. Players then exchange shares that they have purchased over the course of the game for cash, are rewarded for any of the public goals they have accomplished over the five decades of play, and tally their money to determine who is Chicago's greatest resident.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "281722", "name": "City of the Big Shoulders: Burden of Destiny"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 1578, "average": 7.98221, "bayesaverage": 6.74581, "stddev": 1.45547, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2163, "trading": 29, "wanting": 347, "wishing": 1284, "numcomments": 411, "numweights": 116, "averageweight": 4.0345, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 651}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 291}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 43, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "3": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 12}}}, "usersrated": 1578.0, "average": 7.98221, "bayesaverage": 6.74581, "stddev": 1.45547, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2163.0, "trading": 29.0, "wanting": 347.0, "wishing": 1284.0, "numcomments": 411.0, "numweights": 116.0, "averageweight": 4.0345, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 651}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 291}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "214910", "name": "Tiki", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9VlGdJ_dOOrC13biHm_SWw__thumb/img/mSJITl2xNoONpptFhph7kGSM4OY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3327155.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9VlGdJ_dOOrC13biHm_SWw__original/img/7TYkqRXn1USMCAeswqsO6x-wfbA=/0x0/pic3327155.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Theme: Tiki Culture"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Modular Board"], "designers": ["Nicolas Sato"], "artists": ["Pauline Amelin"], "publishers": ["\u00d4z Editions"], "description": "In Tiki, you are a divinity on Manami Island and you love all the delicious fruits that grow there. You prefer nothing more than influencing the living tribes of the island to share their gifts with you. Unfortunately, you aren't the only one. Another divinity shares your passion for these fruits, which leaves you only one choice \u2014 you need to show him your power in order to get more fruits than he does before the end of the fruit season.\n\nTo set up, shuffle the nine village tiles and place them in a 3x3 square with some space between each tile. Players then take turns until the fruit supply exhausted or one of them collects four fruits. On a turn, a player creates a new totem (by placing one of their totem tokens on an empty village tile) or moves a totem that has one of their tokens on top. When you move a totem, you must move the entire totem orthogonally as many spaces as the number of tokens in it. As you move, you drop the bottommost token in each village through which you pass, placing the dropped tokens on top of any totem already located there.\n\nWhen a totem has three tokens stacked in it, the village it's in is influenced, with the player who owns the top token winning a number of fruits equal to the number on the village tile. After this, remove the tokens in this totem and return them to their owners. If a village has a 0 on it, then the tokens are returned with no one collecting fruit; if a village has -1, then the owner of the top totem removes one of their collected fruits from the game.\n\nAs soon as a player has four fruit, they win.

Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a \u201claboratory\u201d for what would become the Portuguese Empire.\n\nWheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.\n\nPlayers try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.\nMadeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.\n\nThe Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown.

To face these challenges, you must put on your foreman clothes. Between hiring workers, managing their organization, purchasing slaves or tools, and taking out loans, you'll have to make the right decisions to fulfill your dream: Becoming the greatest builder the age has ever known.\n\nIn the game, players score points (and gain money) by completing the construction of buildings. Each building has four characteristics \u2014 carpentry, masonry, architecture, painting \u2014 rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building, but placing a worker on a construction site costs money.\n\nEach turn players have three free actions; however, for an added cost players may also chose to buy additional actions during their turn. Unlike in The Builders: Middle Ages, players can acquire slaves and put them to work, but if they don't pay to free the slaves by the end of the game, they lose points. Other changes from the original game include the ability to send your workers to universities or purchase tools to improve their characteristics.\n\nMake use of your workers, of your slaves, or your freed slaves to build your buildings and amass victory points to ultimately be named the greatest builder of all!\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 1331, "average": 6.75011, "bayesaverage": 6.07528, "stddev": 1.16515, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2831, "trading": 96, "wanting": 41, "wishing": 205, "numcomments": 305, "numweights": 61, "averageweight": 1.918, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2084}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 566}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 18, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "2": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 8}}}, "usersrated": 1331.0, "average": 6.75011, "bayesaverage": 6.07528, "stddev": 1.16515, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2831.0, "trading": 96.0, "wanting": 41.0, "wishing": 205.0, "numcomments": 305.0, "numweights": 61.0, "averageweight": 1.918, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2084}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 566}], "game_family": "The Builders", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "161417", "name": "Red7", "alternative_names": ["7 Rosso", "Red", "Red 7", "Red Seven", "Ruz7"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7zH6Kt5ebWEixjDGmHweNA__thumb/img/PVkJyJhCtzo1ZwKO4iuRaqUyKJc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2247258.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7zH6Kt5ebWEixjDGmHweNA__original/img/BlQg-C_qu02XAyIXZICX9znzfF0=/0x0/pic2247258.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Number"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Carl Chudyk", "Chris Cieslik"], "artists": ["Alanna Cervenak"], "publishers": ["Asmadi Games", "999 Games", "Albi", "Bureau de Juegos", "Cranio Creations", "Hobby World", "Lucrum Games", "MINDOK", "Nuts!

The game ends when one player reaches 0. The player scoring the most points wins.\n\nThe dealer deals the cards so that the lowest number of cards remains undealt: for example with four players, five cards are dealt to each player and two cards are put aside.\n\nThe player to his left announces how many tricks he thinks he will win, then the player on his left, etc... This is the contract. The dealer is the last to announce, but the sum of announced tricks must not equal the number of cards dealt to each player.\n\nLet us follow the same example, where 5 cards were dealt to each player: player A announces 2 tricks, players B and C each announce 1 trick. Then the dealer cannot announce 1 trick because the total would be 5 tricks and each player could fulfill his contract. The player to the left of the dealer starts. The winner of a trick is the one who will start the next trick. The owner of the fool must assign its value (0 or 22) when he plays it.\n\nAt the end of the round, each player counts the number of tricks he has won and compare it to the number of tricks he has announced. No point is awarded for fulfilling the contract, but 1 point is deducted for each missed trick, either over or under the number of tricks the player initially announced.\n\nThe next round takes place in the same way, but with one less card per player.\n\nAfter several rounds where one less card is dealt in each round, there is a round where each player only receives one card. Each player then places the card on its forehead without looking at it, so that all players except him can see the card. Each player then announces if he will win the trick or not. As was the case in previous rounds, the sum of announced tricks cannot equal the number of cards dealt to each player (i.e. one).\n\nAfter this round, in each round the number of cards dealt to each player is increased by one, until the number of cards is the same as in the first round.\nIf we follow the same example as above (with 4 players), here are the numbers of cards dealt to each player in each round: 5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-4-3...\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 0, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 0, "stats": {"usersrated": 29, "average": 6.44828, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 1.36675, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14, "trading": 0, "wanting": 0, "wishing": 1, "numcomments": 9, "numweights": 2, "averageweight": 1.5, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 0, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}}}, "usersrated": 29.0, "average": 6.44828, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 1.36675, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 1.0, "numcomments": 9.0, "numweights": 2.0, "averageweight": 1.5, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "12995", "name": "Dungeon Twister", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fngIoEZCqy8mAFmygDdbCg__thumb/img/OSC45vms69MYZKZZ2e04QT12icU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic97630.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fngIoEZCqy8mAFmygDdbCg__original/img/LmjTmg0wfmeTZX8RXSVPm4kB-fE=/0x0/pic97630.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Dungeon Twister", "Players: Two Player Only Games"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Maze"], "implementations": ["Dungeon Twister 2: Prison", "Dungeon Twister: The Card Game"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Map Deformation", "Modular Board", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Christophe Boelinger"], "artists": ["Thierry Masson", "Wayne Reynolds"], "publishers": ["Pro Ludo", "Asmodee", "Edge Entertainment", "Nexus Editrice"], "description": "Dungeon Twister is a 2-player high level strategy game where 2 teams of adventurers with various powers are trapped in a dungeon.

Points are collected by moving adventurers out of the dungeon or by killing an opponent's adventurer. Objects are disseminated across the whole dungeon and will bring the adventurers well-needed powers.\n\nEach player has the same characters, each with different powers. Some run fast, some fight or disarm traps. The cleric heals, magician burns everything in sight, and the goblin is so weak that the simple fact of getting him out will bring you two victory points.\n\nCombat and actions are managed via cards. To move, fight, heal, or turn a room, you must manage action points obtained by playing cards. Those cards are not drawn but selected from a set of cards by both players. Both players have access to the same panel of cards at the beginning of the game, so the game is really about managing the resources and adapting to the changing environment.\n\nDungeon Twister is the original game in the Dungeon Twister series\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "80115", "name": "Dungeon Twister:  Room P3"}, {"id": "14533", "name": "Dungeon Twister: 3/4 Players Expansion"}, {"id": "25724", "name": "Dungeon Twister: \u00c0 Feu et \u00c0 Sang"}, {"id": "246497", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Amazone"}, {"id": "72366", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Beggar"}, {"id": "80499", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Bonus Objects"}, {"id": "27099", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Cr\u00e9atures Sylvestres"}, {"id": "72408", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Disciple"}, {"id": "165213", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Dwarf Elf Slayer"}, {"id": "165214", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Father Christmas"}, {"id": "17565", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Fire and Water"}, {"id": "20435", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Forces of Darkness"}, {"id": "80011", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Forest Elf"}, {"id": "80013", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Insaisissable"}, {"id": "80007", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Master of Time"}, {"id": "21795", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Mercenaries"}, {"id": "23300", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Minotaur"}, {"id": "81180", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Neutral Characters"}, {"id": "72367", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Ogre"}, {"id": "13809", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Paladins & Dragons"}, {"id": "26136", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Purple Dragon"}, {"id": "80016", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Room P1"}, {"id": "80781", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Room P2"}, {"id": "31736", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Terres de Glace"}, {"id": "80008", "name": "Dungeon Twister: The Merciless One"}, {"id": "117794", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Traps"}, {"id": "80010", "name": "Dungeon Twister: Zephyr, the Cheater"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2004, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 11, "stats": {"usersrated": 5723, "average": 6.83034, "bayesaverage": 6.51495, "stddev": 1.51271, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7576, "trading": 482, "wanting": 168, "wishing": 990, "numcomments": 1872, "numweights": 684, "averageweight": 2.886, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 990}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 606}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 60, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "2": {"best_rating": 56, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 36}}}, "usersrated": 5723.0, "average": 6.83034, "bayesaverage": 6.51495, "stddev": 1.51271, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7576.0, "trading": 482.0, "wanting": 168.0, "wishing": 990.0, "numcomments": 1872.0, "numweights": 684.0, "averageweight": 2.886, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 990}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 606}], "game_family": "Dungeon Twister", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 27, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "102148", "name": "NOIR: Deductive Mystery Game", "alternative_names": ["Noir of Indines", "NOIR: Deductive Mystery Game \u2013 Black Box Edition", "NOIR: Killer vs. Inspector", "\u041d\u0443\u0430\u0440"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sr2p-nAHmhd5uMWWWrY2yA__thumb/img/v2gkZQXUr-0Hl8mf3ThDHhw9ILk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2461527.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sr2p-nAHmhd5uMWWWrY2yA__original/img/In3aKAw59Pnw9_rRHOO4zf8gO3Y=/0x0/pic2461527.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Series: Minigame Library (Level 99 Games)", "Series: Small Box (Level 99 Games)"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "implementations": ["Automata NOIR"], "mechanics": ["Secret Unit Deployment", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["D.

You represent a new airline that's trying to set up business in the U.S., but you have an entire country open to you, so where will you set up shop and how can you profit more than the other newcomers to ensure that you survive?\n\nIn Blue Skies, the game board presents players with thirty airports in thirty cities. Each airport has four gates, with you using 2-4 gates depending on the number of players. To set up, draw airport demand cards from the deck to seed airports with passengers. Whenever you place passengers on the board, draw from a bag that initially contains 100 red cubes and 25 green cubes; for each airport, continue drawing until you draw a red cube, then redistribute passengers at the open gates of that airport as evenly as possible.\n\n(Note that at most the first five airports drawn will have an open gate, and even those will start with only one open gate run by a local airline. All of the other passengers are just bunched up at the gate waiting for you to serve them!)\n\nEach player starts with three demand cards in hand, and they take turns choosing two gates with a purchase price of at most 6. Players adjust their income from 0, with their income being set to equal the number of passengers now waiting at their gates, then the game begins.\n\nOn a turn, each player in turn buys new gates at airports of their choice, spending at most 6 points and adding any unspent points to their score. You can buy out a local airline, set up gates in new cities, or purchase multiple gates in the same airport to try to dominate that area.\n\nEach player in turn then plays a demand card from their hand, drawing passengers form the bag to place one or more passengers at that location. Then demand cards equal to the number of players are drawn, and more passengers are ahead to those airports. The game board lists the number of cards for each airport, so you somewhat know the odds of where passengers might arrive.\n\nPlayers adjust their income to account for the opening of new gates, the redistribution of existing passengers, and the arrival of new passengers, then they add their income to their score. If a player now has at least 100 points or has placed their twentieth and final gate, the game ends immediately; otherwise, you add a local airline gate to each airport with passengers but no open gates, pass the first player marker, then start a new round.\n\nAt game's end, score the seven regions of the United States based on the player's dominance of those regions. Each airport has a scoring value, e.g., ORD is worth 4, and each gate you have in Chicago is worth 4 for determining dominance in both the Midwest region and the Central region.

Only those who will be able to use their dwindling resources to meet the increasing demands over five rounds will find a spot for themselves on the beach.\n\nIn Hawaii, players must make use of their limited resources to score points by growing their villages and exploring the surrounding islands. Your chieftains move around the board to purchase new tiles for their villages, hopefully grabbing the best deals before their opponents.

Immerse yourself in it's mythological theme as players deplete their enemy\u2019s health to win the battle.\n\nSummoners begin the battle with basic creature and spell cards. Creatures will gift the summoner with worshipers in the form of blue and red dice. The more creatures you summon, the more dice you will gain. Summoners build their army using the occult symbols on the dice. These symbols gain and activate spells, creatures, auras and curses from a common pool of cards.\n\nSpells are powerful actions like summoning mythical creatures and casting fireballs. Creatures can be used against an enemy to attack and defend. Auras can strengthen a summoner\u2019s army while curses hinder an enemy. Deplete your enemy\u2019s health to eliminate them and win the battle.\n\nEach turn is split into 2 stages: gain and combat. In the gain stage, the player gathers the dice earned by their creatures. They then roll these dice. In the combat stage, players can use the actions available to them on their cards in any order. These actions are cast, ability, and defend. When using these actions they must match the dice symbols or types of creatures on the card. They may end their turn at any moment during the combat stage. Play then continues to the next player. The game ends when one player's hp goes to 0 or below. That player is eliminated. The remaining player wins and is declared the greatest summoner.\n\n-description from designer\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 0, "stats": {"usersrated": 45, "average": 6.46, "bayesaverage": 5.51786, "stddev": 2.37921, "median": 0.0, "owned": 37, "trading": 1, "wanting": 2, "wishing": 12, "numcomments": 22, "numweights": 1, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 13870}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 2, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}}}, "usersrated": 45.0, "average": 6.46, "bayesaverage": 5.51786, "stddev": 2.37921, "median": 0.0, "owned": 37.0, "trading": 1.0, "wanting": 2.0, "wishing": 12.0, "numcomments": 22.0, "numweights": 1.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 13870}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "252997", "name": "Mapmaker: The Gerrymandering Game", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JQGTR0FakZt_ZRXgqrhP7g__thumb/img/YQddGHfh_7PdkhzJxDCzypcoCgg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4127007.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JQGTR0FakZt_ZRXgqrhP7g__original/img/r0mhDG6_YygtV0VuHCFI9qPuxTE=/0x0/pic4127007.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Political: Elections"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Political"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Enclosure"], "designers": ["Louis Lafair", "Joshua Lafair", "Becca Lafair"], "artists": ["Julia Semionova"], "publishers": ["Lafair Family Games", "Go!

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.\n\nGameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\n  \n     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\n\nEach mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\n\nThe second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\n\nAs a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\n\nVictory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 & 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 & 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 & 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn\u2019t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn\u2019s progress lost.\n\nA predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "164592", "name": "Can't Stop: Rollin' Down the Highway"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1980, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 9, "stats": {"usersrated": 12835, "average": 6.84957, "bayesaverage": 6.69313, "stddev": 1.29701, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11564, "trading": 233, "wanting": 393, "wishing": 1591, "numcomments": 3572, "numweights": 889, "averageweight": 1.1575, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 724}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 188}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 198, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 120}, "2": {"best_rating": 53, "recommended_rating": 119, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "3": {"best_rating": 130, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 52, "recommended_rating": 97, "not_recommended_rating": 30}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 109}}}, "usersrated": 12835.0, "average": 6.84957, "bayesaverage": 6.69313, "stddev": 1.29701, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11564.0, "trading": 233.0, "wanting": 393.0, "wishing": 1591.0, "numcomments": 3572.0, "numweights": 889.0, "averageweight": 1.1575, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 724}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 188}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "45", "name": "Perudo", "alternative_names": ["Animal House Liar's Dice", "Blef", "Bl\u00f6ff", "Bluff", "Bl\u00f8ff", "Call my Bluff", "Doubter's Dice", "Dubito", "Dudo: The Origin of Liar's Dice", "Duff Dice: The Lyin' Dice Game", "Futurama: Bender's Game of Bluff", "Hide Da Dice", "Liar's Dice", "Liar's Dice / D\u00e9s Voil\u00e9s", "Liars Dice", "Luckigames", "Luring", "Perudo Pocket Sized", "Perudo: Beach", "Perudo: Liars Dice of the Andes", "Pirates Dice: Pirates of the Caribbean \u2013 At World's End", "Pirates Dice: Pirates of the Caribbean \u2013 Dead Man's Chest", "Roodo", "Wayne's World NOT Dice Game", "\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e: \u0425\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a", "\ud398\ub8e8\ub3c4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCiGSoCqbOsXS8JzZZC_SA__thumb/img/g9ex_JOJ3_3fekn4UBwx0iiE6Ik=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3949242.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCiGSoCqbOsXS8JzZZC_SA__original/img/to9uRKbaaTqTmQWXtcA0k8OuA9I=/0x0/pic3949242.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Brands: Disney", "Mechanism: Bluffing \u2013 Dice Cup", "Movies: Pirates of the Caribbean", "TV Shows: The Simpsons", "TV Shows: Wayne's World"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Dice", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Party Game"], "implementations": ["Bluff Jubil\u00e4umsausgabe"], "mechanics": ["Betting and Bluffing", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination"], "designers": ["Richard Borg"], "artists": ["(Uncredited)", "Rita \u00c5se", "Bildg\u00e5rden AB", "Design Edge", "H.P.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u201310 in five different colors with three special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40.

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.\n\nThe current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178037", "name": "Beguile: PaWN The Enemy"}, {"id": "231140", "name": "Castle-Mate"}, {"id": "111363", "name": "Chess Mixer"}, {"id": "182105", "name": "CHUCK-A-CHESS"}, {"id": "251614", "name": "Code Geass: Knightmare Chess"}, {"id": "304216", "name": "Devil's Chess"}, {"id": "147313", "name": "Epic Chess"}, {"id": "191960", "name": "Fairy Tale Chess"}, {"id": "302023", "name": "Fantasy Crusaders Chess"}, {"id": "195997", "name": "Heretik Chess"}, {"id": "187247", "name": "Kingdom of Elbrandt"}, {"id": "227", "name": "Knightmare Chess"}, {"id": "155192", "name": "Knightmare Chess (Third Edition)"}, {"id": "1677", "name": "Knightmare Chess 2"}, {"id": "262716", "name": "Musketeer Chess"}, {"id": "144576", "name": "Rogue Chess"}, {"id": "67707", "name": "Royal Chess"}, {"id": "147119", "name": "Spell Chess: an Expansion to Chess"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1475, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 6, "stats": {"usersrated": 27947, "average": 7.11553, "bayesaverage": 6.93488, "stddev": 1.8353, "median": 0.0, "owned": 38705, "trading": 182, "wanting": 29, "wishing": 293, "numcomments": 6446, "numweights": 2290, "averageweight": 3.7022, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 441}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 49}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 346, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 251}, "2": {"best_rating": 327, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "2+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 277}}}, "usersrated": 27947.0, "average": 7.11553, "bayesaverage": 6.93488, "stddev": 1.8353, "median": 0.0, "owned": 38705.0, "trading": 182.0, "wanting": 29.0, "wishing": 293.0, "numcomments": 6446.0, "numweights": 2290.0, "averageweight": 3.7022, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 441}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 49}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 18, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "172", "name": "For Sale", "alternative_names": ["EladLak!", "Garage (\u06af\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062c)", "Na prodej", "Na sprzeda\u017c", "Se Vende", "Se v\u20acnde", "Vende-se", "\u0417 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430!", "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e!", "\u05e0\u05d3\u05dc\"\u05df \u05d1\u05e7\u05d8\u05df", "\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e02\u0e32\u0e22!", "\u5730\u7522\u9054\u4eba", "\u623f\u5730\u7522\u62cd\u8ce3 (\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u62cd\u5356)", "\ud22c\uc790\uc655 \ud3ec\uc138\uc77c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dJh9HkZC346NgPTAicJq_A__thumb/img/3cgW5aP-JJeKSpZMjA0NFheMnfY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1513085.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dJh9HkZC346NgPTAicJq_A__original/img/vw0xKvS_ZIxGKFVSDtvPnebUI9A=/0x0/pic1513085.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Series: Bookshelf (Gryphon Games)", "Series: Mini Games (IELLO)"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Economic"], "implementations": ["For Sale Autorama"], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Auction: Sealed Bid", "Auction: Turn Order Until Pass", "Hand Management", "Selection Order Bid"], "designers": ["Stefan Dorra"], "artists": ["\u00d3scar Aguado", "Abbas Amirabadi", "Alvin Madden", "Mahmoud Arasteh Nasab", "Mohammad Amir Garoosian", "Emilien Rotival", "Catell Ruz", "Uros Vuckovic", "Klaus Wilinski"], "publishers": ["2 Pionki", "Albi", "AURUM, Inc.", "Baborka Games", "Brain Games", "Compaya.hu - Gamer Caf\u00e9 Kft.", "Competo / Marektoy", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "F.X.

But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.\n\nThe earliest mention of Go (\u00e5\u0153\u008d\u00e6\u00a3\u2039 (w\u00e9i q\u00ed)- \"surrounding game\") appears in the \"Analects\" of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17\u00d717 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).\n\nA Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as Connect6, Go-Moku, and Pente.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "253107", "name": "Joker Go"}, {"id": "219234", "name": "Poker-Go"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": -2200, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 14604, "average": 7.63959, "bayesaverage": 7.33261, "stddev": 1.9096, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20037, "trading": 266, "wanting": 148, "wishing": 1615, "numcomments": 3674, "numweights": 1413, "averageweight": 3.9993, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 165}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 13}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 213, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 135}, "2": {"best_rating": 203, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 139}}}, "usersrated": 14604.0, "average": 7.63959, "bayesaverage": 7.33261, "stddev": 1.9096, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20037.0, "trading": 266.0, "wanting": 148.0, "wishing": 1615.0, "numcomments": 3674.0, "numweights": 1413.0, "averageweight": 3.9993, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 165}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 13}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "394", "name": "Kahuna", "alternative_names": ["\u30ab\u30d5\u30ca\u306e\u5cf6\u3005", "\uce74\ud6c4\ub098"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UdhhVlmQihMbvlNSvY1lUA__thumb/img/bc5NxkspfUfPskxlC30SxlwNyxs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2606165.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UdhhVlmQihMbvlNSvY1lUA__original/img/sG8Gjsd3AdIYaREO4HHJK7jWtoI=/0x0/pic2606165.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Players: Two Player Only Games", "Series: Two-player games (Kosmos)", "Theme: Tropical", "Theme: Tropical Islands"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": ["Kanaloa", "Arabana-Ikibiti"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Network and Route Building", "Take That"], "designers": ["G\u00fcnter Cornett"], "artists": ["Michaela Kienle", "Anke Pohl", "Thilo Rick", "Claus Stephan"], "publishers": ["KOSMOS", "999 Games", "Arclight", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "IELLO", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Laser plus", "Paper Iyagi", "Rio Grande Games", "Tilsit", "White Goblin Games"], "description": "Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna \u2013 part of its Kosmos two-player series \u2013 is the best known implementation of this design.\n\nIt's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island \u2013 which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.\n\nThe game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.\n\nThe Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.\n\nReimplements:\n\n     Arabana-Ikibiti\n\n\n\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n     Kanaloa\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1998, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 40, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 40, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 8255, "average": 6.63261, "bayesaverage": 6.43727, "stddev": 1.25457, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11716, "trading": 400, "wanting": 196, "wishing": 1173, "numcomments": 2071, "numweights": 541, "averageweight": 2.0573, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1105}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 86}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 51, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 38}, "2": {"best_rating": 50, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 37}}}, "usersrated": 8255.0, "average": 6.63261, "bayesaverage": 6.43727, "stddev": 1.25457, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11716.0, "trading": 400.0, "wanting": 196.0, "wishing": 1173.0, "numcomments": 2071.0, "numweights": 541.0, "averageweight": 2.0573, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1105}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 86}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "432", "name": "6 nimmt!", "alternative_names": ["6 bere!", "6 ima!", "6 neemt!", "6 nimmt!

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.\n\nTo play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.\n\nIn addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!\n\n6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "20030", "name": "6 nimmt!

Plus there is usually a nil bid, which means you personally won't take any tricks but your partner still plays as normal.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1938, "minplayers": 4, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 2058, "average": 6.74438, "bayesaverage": 6.19797, "stddev": 1.511, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1222, "trading": 1, "wanting": 3, "wishing": 24, "numcomments": 501, "numweights": 168, "averageweight": 2.0357, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1690}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 458}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 27, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 23}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 21}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "4": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 19}}}, "usersrated": 2058.0, "average": 6.74438, "bayesaverage": 6.19797, "stddev": 1.511, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1222.0, "trading": 1.0, "wanting": 3.0, "wishing": 24.0, "numcomments": 501.0, "numweights": 168.0, "averageweight": 2.0357, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1690}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 458}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "624", "name": "Quoridor", "alternative_names": ["Bloqueio", "Bloqueio 4 cores", "Mini Quoridor", "Mini-Bloqueio 2 cores", "Mini-Bloqueio 4 cores", "Quizdoor", "Quoridor Classic", "Quoridor Deluxe", "Quoridor Mini", "Quoridor Pocket", "Quoridor Travel", "\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8", "\ucffc\ub9ac\ub3c4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I1YNAhee09mryaqfEo8MwA__thumb/img/9TJaxgoMUkiMhAGSYM8-0o1ICpg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3488232.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I1YNAhee09mryaqfEo8MwA__original/img/T8PwrJu6SrjMPtFtvviY8YwUMrI=/0x0/pic3488232.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Game: Blockade", "Misc: Mensa Select", "Series: Classic (Gigamic)"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Maze"], "implementations": ["Quoridor Kid", "Pinko Pallino"], "mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Square Grid"], "designers": ["Mirko Marchesi"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["(Unknown)", "Family Games, Inc.", "FoxMind Israel", "Fundex", "Gigamic", "Great American Trading Company", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Ludens Spirit", "Marks & Spencer", "Mitra", "Oficina do Aprendiz", "Smart Chick"], "description": "The abstract strategy game Quoridor is surprisingly deep for its simple rules.

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.\n\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: \"Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?\" or \"Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?\" Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.\n\nFirst game in the Carcassonne series.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeschreibung\n\nEine mittelalterliche Landschaft mit St\u00e4dten und Kl\u00f6stern, Stra\u00dfen und Wiesen.

Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.\n\nDownforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.\n\nThis is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play.

Tarock deck.  Common to these games is a round of bidding followed by a round of announcements indicating bonuses that will be attempted during the round of play, and doublings of the game, or any of the announced bonuses. The deck consists of 4 suits (usually clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds), and a permanent trump suit (Tarock) of 22 cards.\n\nThere are variants of tarock for 2 to 5 players.\n\nStraw man tarock is a variant for 2 players where each players hand is augmented by cards dealt out into piles in front of him/her at the beginning of the game.\n\nTapp tarock is a variant for 3 players that does away with the bid to 'call a king'.\n\nK\u00f6nigrufen is a variant for 4 active players (with 5 one player deals and sits out that round) who are dealt 12 cards and 6 for the talon, bidding indicates how many cards will be used from the talon with the remaining cards being split by the other players. The declarer calls a trump (XIX) or one of the kings to indicate a partner (the partner does not indicate this fact though), after which players can make bonus announcements and doublings. During the play, suit must be followed and trump must be played if you are out of the suit. Points are counted after each round and the declarer, generally, needs to take more than half in order to fulfill the contract.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n    http://www.tarok4.com/ (Slovenian)\n    http://igrajmo.se/\n\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1425, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 0, "stats": {"usersrated": 150, "average": 7.3584, "bayesaverage": 5.65766, "stddev": 1.9458, "median": 0.0, "owned": 221, "trading": 0, "wanting": 1, "wishing": 24, "numcomments": 58, "numweights": 15, "averageweight": 3.5333, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 5474}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 14, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 8}}}, "usersrated": 150.0, "average": 7.3584, "bayesaverage": 5.65766, "stddev": 1.9458, "median": 0.0, "owned": 221.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 1.0, "wishing": 24.0, "numcomments": 58.0, "numweights": 15.0, "averageweight": 3.5333, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 5474}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "156566", "name": "Lords of Xidit", "alternative_names": ["\u30af\u30b7\u30c7\u30c3\u30a3\u30c8\u738b\u56fd\u8a18"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KluVg27eXcpbH-_lUWgyKA__thumb/img/DE3_O8NSQl9-RbBe_dIfjgo_bNo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2074460.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KluVg27eXcpbH-_lUWgyKA__original/img/cRVKfcEvj99teASQiIOb-FBWGRY=/0x0/pic2074460.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Setting: Kingdom of Xidit"], "categories": ["Fantasy"], "implementations": ["Himalaya", "Himalaya: The 5-6 Player Expansion"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Area Majority / Influence", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Programmed Movement", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "designers": ["R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e"], "artists": ["Xavier Gueniffey Durin", "St\u00e9phane Gantiez"], "publishers": ["Libellud", "Asterion Press", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "The Black Southern Host has arisen, corrupting the hearts of the indigenous creatures.

As with most games in this genre, the base objective of each round is to capture a certain amount of card points (in this case, more than half) in tricks. However, each round of Hungarian Tarokk starts with a peculiar round of auctions and announcements that impart a lot of information about the players' hands, which make it a very skillful, challenging, yet surprisingly accessible game.\n\nIt uses a shortened pack of 42 cards: the trump suit consists of 22 cards while the other four suits consist of only five cards each. The size of each player\u2019s hand is only nine cards (with a talon of six cards).\n\nEach round starts with a short auction in which players bid for the right to choose a partner that holds a particular high ranking trump card, usually the XX. The bid itself determines the number of cards the winner of the auction may exchange (higher bids mean less cards exchanged) and the base value of  game (to capture more than half of the card points in tricks) in points.\n\nPlayers have restrictions on how they may bid; in particular, a player may only bid only if he or she holds an honour (the lowest trump, the second-highest trump, or the highest trump). In addition, there are bidding conventions that, unlike Bridge, are part of the rules. These conventions, or \"invitation bids,\" indicate if a player holds a particular high ranking trump.\n\nAfter players exchange cards with the talon, there is a round of announcements. Partnerships can pursue additional objectives other than game:\n\n- Winning three-fourths of the card points\n- Winning all the tricks\n- Winning all three honours\n- Winning all four kings\n- Winning the last trick with the lowest trump\n- XXI-catch: Capturing the opponent's second highest trump with the highest trump\n\nDuring the round of announcements, a partnership may announce that they will accomplish one or more of these objectives, which doubles their value. A partnership may also challenge or kontra an announcement, which also doubles its value. These objectives are scored independently; a team can fail at accomplishing game but still accomplish (and score for) other objectives. Often, the value of these objectives is greater than game. For example, the base value of game ranges from 1 to 4 points, while the value of XXI-catch is 21 points.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1870, "minplayers": 4, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 23, "average": 7.3913, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 1.81154, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19, "trading": 0, "wanting": 1, "wishing": 7, "numcomments": 8, "numweights": 3, "averageweight": 3.3333, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 0, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}}}, "usersrated": 23.0, "average": 7.3913, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 1.81154, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 1.0, "wishing": 7.0, "numcomments": 8.0, "numweights": 3.0, "averageweight": 3.3333, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "21763", "name": "Mr. Jack", "alternative_names": ["Une Ombre sur Whitechapel"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CDdF4xOQJsNK0gX8-tBdCQ__thumb/img/5b44BrekfAQznAhRIOSPDtwHMsg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3066125.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CDdF4xOQJsNK0gX8-tBdCQ__original/img/EMVEbNvm38lZHe6Jw12f7CnCiPY=/0x0/pic3066125.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Books: Sherlock Holmes", "Cities: London (England)", "Country: England", "Game: Mr. Jack", "Historical Figures: Jack the Ripper", "Players: Two Player Only Games"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "implementations": ["Le Fant\u00f4me de l'Op\u00e9ra", "Mr. Jack in New York", "Mr. Jack Pocket"], "mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Bruno Cathala", "Ludovic Maublanc"], "artists": ["Pier\u00f4"], "publishers": ["Hurrican", "Brain Games", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Lautapelit.fi", "Neuroludic", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "In Mr. Jack, one of the two players represents Jack the Ripper, who will be one of the eight characters on the board.

The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.\n\nPlayers build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities.  Each route must consist of at least three cities.  Players may only build one route at a time.  Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.\n\nPlayers start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card.  The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards.  On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one.  If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it.  The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage.  Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route.  Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn.\n\nWhen a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered.  Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends.  Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, and lose points for unplaced post offices.  The player with the most points wins.\n\nThe fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "33261", "name": "Thurn and Taxis: All Roads Lead to Rome"}, {"id": "27690", "name": "Thurn and Taxis: Power and Glory"}, {"id": "25293", "name": "Thurn und Taxis: Der Kurier der F\u00fcrstin"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2006, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 17850, "average": 7.1024, "bayesaverage": 6.9579, "stddev": 1.17603, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20061, "trading": 505, "wanting": 449, "wishing": 2003, "numcomments": 4017, "numweights": 1797, "averageweight": 2.2615, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 419}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 292}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 92}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 291, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 142}, "2": {"best_rating": 73, "recommended_rating": 158, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "3": {"best_rating": 145, "recommended_rating": 102, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 146, "recommended_rating": 89, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 119}}}, "usersrated": 17850.0, "average": 7.1024, "bayesaverage": 6.9579, "stddev": 1.17603, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20061.0, "trading": 505.0, "wanting": 449.0, "wishing": 2003.0, "numcomments": 4017.0, "numweights": 1797.0, "averageweight": 2.2615, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 419}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 292}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 92}], "game_family": "Thurn and Taxis", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "22501", "name": "See Sek", "alternative_names": ["Bai Tu Sac", "Four Colour Cards", "Si Se Pai", "\u56db\u8272\u724c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OJc7u8C7Un7I13E72ERAaQ__thumb/img/1P2VZEIAnWvAdLYf9iP1Hn_3cQw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic117646.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OJc7u8C7Un7I13E72ERAaQ__original/img/y-coNpuReabX6sIHm0_9oSzU8NY=/0x0/pic117646.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Draw and Discard", "Card Games: Exchange", "Traditional Card Games: Rummy"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Set Collection"], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["(Public Domain)"], "description": "This entry serves to represent the various games (mainly rummy games) that may be played with the See Sek deck of cards.\n\nSee Sek (also translated  as Soo Sik; in HanYu PinYin it is Si Se) literally means four colors in Hokkien.

As with most Chinese traditional playing cards, the cards are much longer than they are wide. However, there are regional variants with shorter cards.\n\nNote that See Sek is different from Chess cards that only come in two colors and which are used for a different game.\n\nA full deck consists of 112 cards: 28 cards in each of 4 suits (the colors). Each suit has the Chinese characters for the seven types of XiangQi pieces, repeated four times.\n\nThey are often used to play Rummy-type games and the melds may be three or four of exactly the same kind, three or four of a kind but in all different colors, single-card melds (the General or Ong), and three-card melds in 'sequence' and in the same color. There are two 'sequences': Ong, Soo and Chiau (Jiang, Shi, Xiang); and Koo, Beh, Pow (Ju, Ma, Pao).\n\nIn Singapore and Malaysia, these card games are often played by Hokkiens and Teochews.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 0, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 10, "minplaytime": 10, "maxplaytime": 10, "minage": 0, "stats": {"usersrated": 24, "average": 5.09583, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 1.57942, "median": 0.0, "owned": 42, "trading": 1, "wanting": 3, "wishing": 2, "numcomments": 10, "numweights": 4, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}}}, "usersrated": 24.0, "average": 5.09583, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 1.57942, "median": 0.0, "owned": 42.0, "trading": 1.0, "wanting": 3.0, "wishing": 2.0, "numcomments": 10.0, "numweights": 4.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "22847", "name": "Connect6", "alternative_names": ["li\u00f9z\u01d0q\u00ed", "Roku-Moku", "rokumoku", "rokumoku-narabe", "\u516d\u5b50\u68cb", "\u516d\u76ee\u4e26\u3079", "\uc721\ubaa9"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WyCzpxelmFnKDrrJjy8sOQ__thumb/img/f5_IrP_L3s4x0VREuHdyLUk6GNg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic120921.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WyCzpxelmFnKDrrJjy8sOQ__original/img/X0sh96BwLGAVVlOS_IUkhjl9CNU=/0x0/pic120921.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Category: n in a row", "Traditional Games: Go"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Pattern Building"], "designers": ["Professor I-Chen Wu"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["(Public Domain)"], "description": "Connect6 is an abstract strategy game similar to Go-Moku.

Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "280833", "name": "Through the Ages: New Leaders and Wonders"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 22233, "average": 8.43582, "bayesaverage": 8.19648, "stddev": 1.50761, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25967, "trading": 337, "wanting": 1050, "wishing": 7638, "numcomments": 3310, "numweights": 1109, "averageweight": 4.4121, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 6}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 6}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 530, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 305}, "2": {"best_rating": 130, "recommended_rating": 314, "not_recommended_rating": 35}, "3": {"best_rating": 346, "recommended_rating": 121, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4": {"best_rating": 83, "recommended_rating": 225, "not_recommended_rating": 134}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 274}}}, "usersrated": 22233.0, "average": 8.43582, "bayesaverage": 8.19648, "stddev": 1.50761, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25967.0, "trading": 337.0, "wanting": 1050.0, "wishing": 7638.0, "numcomments": 3310.0, "numweights": 1109.0, "averageweight": 4.4121, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 6}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 6}], "game_family": "Through the Ages", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "182116", "name": "Dingo's Dreams", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e3f9Uadm87fg5gxYDpslzg__thumb/img/jWfP_l1QjXRj8D2ZBcv5PdIp1eU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2624852.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e3f9Uadm87fg5gxYDpslzg__original/img/AAHktVga_4OYU-cAhqA8qIMFLnY=/0x0/pic2624852.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Australia", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "categories": ["Animals", "Fantasy", "Puzzle"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Bingo", "Modular Board", "Pattern Building", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Alf Seegert"], "artists": ["Ryan Laukat"], "publishers": ["Red Raven Games"], "description": "Dingo and his friends have gotten lost on Walkabout!

Each player also starts with one extra tile, with a picture of their animal on it. The opposite side of all dreamscape tiles also has a picture of the animal.

Each player's goal is to guide their animal through the dreamscape by positioning him in a specified pattern (which is different each game).

To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building.\n\nEach player starts the game with 10 ecu and an apprentice. Five workers and five buildings are placed face-up on the table, with the others set aside in separate decks. On a turn, you can take three free actions, then pay 5 ecu for each additional action. The possible actions are:\n\n\n    Open a site - Take one of the five buildings, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.\n    Recruit a worker - Take one of the five workers, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.\n    Assign a worker to a building - Pay the cost of the worker (as he won't work for free!), then place him on a building; when the building's needs are met, you earn the points and coins indicated, then flip the building over. The workers return to your pool of available labor.\n    Get money - Forgo one, two or three actions to earn 1, 3 or 6 ecu.\n\n\nSome completed buildings join your labor pool as they can be used to complete other buildings. As soon as a player reaches 17 points, players finish the round so that everyone has the same number of turns, then you tally points, with each completed card having a point value and each 10 ecu being worth 1 point.

In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.\n\nThe development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.\n\nThere are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?\n\n\nGame Summary\nEach player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:\n- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.\n- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.\n- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.\n\nThe central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:\n- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces\n- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.\n- earn 2 coins\n- take 2 temporary workers\n- jump ahead in turn order\n- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you\n\nEach round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.\n\nAfter 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "206944", "name": "Russian Railroads: American Railroads"}, {"id": "181693", "name": "Russian Railroads: German Railroads"}, {"id": "234335", "name": "Russian Railroads: Juri Dreigleisky"}, {"id": "325037", "name": "Russian Railroads: Manufactory Train"}, {"id": "166410", "name": "Russian Railroads: Mini-Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 14489, "average": 7.77424, "bayesaverage": 7.54685, "stddev": 1.28302, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14628, "trading": 133, "wanting": 1073, "wishing": 3880, "numcomments": 2252, "numweights": 744, "averageweight": 3.4113, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 87}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 66}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 202, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 89}, "2": {"best_rating": 39, "recommended_rating": 121, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "3": {"best_rating": 66, "recommended_rating": 96, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4": {"best_rating": 127, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 89}}}, "usersrated": 14489.0, "average": 7.77424, "bayesaverage": 7.54685, "stddev": 1.28302, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14628.0, "trading": 133.0, "wanting": 1073.0, "wishing": 3880.0, "numcomments": 2252.0, "numweights": 744.0, "averageweight": 3.4113, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 87}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 66}], "game_family": "Russian Railroads", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "229853", "name": "Teotihuacan: City of Gods", "alternative_names": ["Teotihuacan: Citt\u00e0 degli Dei", "Teotihuacan: Ciudad de Dioses", "Teotihuacan: Die Stadt der G\u00f6tter", "Teotihuacan: La Cit\u00e9 Des Dieux", "Teotihuacan: Miasto Bog\u00f3w", "Teotihuacan: Stad der Goden", "\u0422\u0435\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0443\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d. \u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432", "\u30c6\u30aa\u30c6\u30a3\u30ef\u30ab\u30f3\uff1a\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30aa\u30d6\u30b4\u30c3\u30ba", "\ud14c\uc624\ud2f0\uc6b0\uc544\uce78: \uc2e0\ub4e4\uc758 \ub3c4\uc2dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wW5xjgBJcFyLaEWZwrYuKA__thumb/img/MppmP7GtDAfKiB5LiAl-ZtPxOPE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4583626.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wW5xjgBJcFyLaEWZwrYuKA__original/img/gzpgd8o15PVOgMhmcd57QijX57Q=/0x0/pic4583626.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Mexico", "Game: Teotihuacan", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Native Americans / First Peoples"], "categories": ["Ancient"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Rondel", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tile Placement", "Track Movement", "Variable Setup", "Worker Placement", "Worker Placement with Dice Workers"], "designers": ["Daniele Tascini"], "artists": ["Odysseas Stamoglou"], "publishers": ["NSKN Games", "Board&Dice", "Bucaneiros Jogos", "CrowD Games", "Game Harbor", "Giochix.it", "Jumping Turtle Games", "Maldito Games", "Pixie Games", "Portal Games", "Schwerkraft-Verlag", "sternenschimmermeer", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)"], "description": "Travel back in time to the greatest city in Mesoamerica.

The competition isn't sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose.\n\nSaint Petersburg has a board to tally victory points and to set out the four types of cards.  It is the cards themselves that players need to collect.  In each round \u2013 with the number of rounds dependent on the number of players and the randomness of card availability \u2013 players first pay for CRAFTSMEN who supply money for further purchases; then BUILDINGS to score points; then ARISTOCRATS, who are needed for money, points, and end-of-game scoring; and finally, unique cards from all three categories which give greater benefits. During the first rounds, players never have enough money to buy every card they want. During later rounds, they have plenty of money, but the cards they'd like to buy may have already come and gone...\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Sankt Petersburg: Das Bankett\n    Saint Petersburg: New Society & Banquet Expansion (includes The Banquet)\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "29549", "name": "Saint Petersburg: New Society & Banquet Expansion"}, {"id": "21367", "name": "Sankt Petersburg: Das Bankett"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2004, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 14287, "average": 7.30501, "bayesaverage": 7.11106, "stddev": 1.30996, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11917, "trading": 232, "wanting": 553, "wishing": 1898, "numcomments": 3377, "numweights": 1375, "averageweight": 2.4713, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 294}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 210}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 272, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 120}, "2": {"best_rating": 97, "recommended_rating": 115, "not_recommended_rating": 31}, "3": {"best_rating": 75, "recommended_rating": 139, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4": {"best_rating": 152, "recommended_rating": 62, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "4+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 100}}}, "usersrated": 14287.0, "average": 7.30501, "bayesaverage": 7.11106, "stddev": 1.30996, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11917.0, "trading": 232.0, "wanting": 553.0, "wishing": 1898.0, "numcomments": 3377.0, "numweights": 1375.0, "averageweight": 2.4713, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 294}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 210}], "game_family": "Saint Petersburg", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "9220", "name": "Saboteur", "alternative_names": ["Arany\u00e1s\u00f3k", "Sabota\u017cysta", "Sabot\u00e9r", "\u03a3\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1", "\u0413\u043d\u043e\u043c\u044b-\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438", "\u0421\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440", "\u05e1\u05d1\u05d0\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8", "\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0631\u0628", "\u304a\u90aa\u9b54\u8005", "\u77ee\u4eba\u6398\u91d1", "\uc0ac\ubcf4\ud0c0\uc9c0"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0vJwP6NGa7GHPZKC3gplUw__thumb/img/B3j-is62fP09eHP34uFG_gsxNQs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3989824.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0vJwP6NGa7GHPZKC3gplUw__original/img/jhL_ucB9VxMroXQc5Zx0oGstH2U=/0x0/pic3989824.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Saboteur", "Theme: Mining"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Party Game"], "implementations": ["Saboteur: The Lost Mines"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Hidden Roles", "Map Addition", "Network and Route Building", "Take That", "Team-Based Game", "Traitor Game"], "designers": ["Fr\u00e9deric Moyersoen"], "artists": ["Andrea Boekhoff", "Fr\u00e9deric Moyersoen"], "publishers": ["AMIGO", "999 Games", "Albi", "Asmodee", "Boardgame Space", "Br\u00e4dspel.se", "Brain Games", "Bureau de Juegos", "Corfix", "Dal Negro", "Dr. Wood Challenge Centre", "Fractal Juegos", "G3", "Gigamic", "Giochi Uniti", "HaKubia", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Kikigagne?", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Mayfair Games", "Meeples Cafe", "Mercurio", "M\u00f6bius Games", "PaperGames (III)", "Paradigm Infinitum Pte Ltd", "Piatnik", "Sun Team Day Hobby Company", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "VR Distribution", "Z-Man Games, Inc.", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433", "\u0412\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438"], "description": "Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\n\nWith the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.\n\nThe Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.\n\nPlayers have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.\n\nThe Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.\n\nThe miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.\n\nAction Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.\n\nOnce a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.\n\nThe round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.\n\nOnce the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "204573", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016"}, {"id": "91072", "name": "Saboteur 2 (expansion-only editions)"}, {"id": "213290", "name": "Saboteur: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016 Promo"}, {"id": "281313", "name": "Saboteur: Cancellation"}, {"id": "290696", "name": "Saboteur: Das Stollenfest"}, {"id": "279956", "name": "Saboteur: Inventory"}, {"id": "227424", "name": "Saboteur: Map Swap"}, {"id": "158605", "name": "Saboteur: Rock Gold"}, {"id": "201027", "name": "Saboteur: Selfish Dwarf"}, {"id": "233013", "name": "Saboteur: The Wardrobe Cavern"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2004, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 10, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 24999, "average": 6.5785, "bayesaverage": 6.46516, "stddev": 1.2856, "median": 0.0, "owned": 39462, "trading": 741, "wanting": 210, "wishing": 1796, "numcomments": 4573, "numweights": 1441, "averageweight": 1.3282, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1058}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 113}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 338}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 309, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 212}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 212}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 195}, "4": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 99, "not_recommended_rating": 140}, "5": {"best_rating": 57, "recommended_rating": 178, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "6": {"best_rating": 110, "recommended_rating": 130, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "7": {"best_rating": 167, "recommended_rating": 78, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "8": {"best_rating": 139, "recommended_rating": 81, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "9": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 118, "not_recommended_rating": 29}, "10": {"best_rating": 49, "recommended_rating": 120, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "10+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 123}}}, "usersrated": 24999.0, "average": 6.5785, "bayesaverage": 6.46516, "stddev": 1.2856, "median": 0.0, "owned": 39462.0, "trading": 741.0, "wanting": 210.0, "wishing": 1796.0, "numcomments": 4573.0, "numweights": 1441.0, "averageweight": 1.3282, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1058}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 113}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 338}], "game_family": "Saboteur", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "7", "num_expansions": 10, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "bga": true}, {"id": "234834", "name": "Apocalypse au Zoo de Carson City", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aKjqp45y8IEDpnuk9pg-YQ__thumb/img/qPJAv456A4i3Aps8AmavelEMK8A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3771570.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aKjqp45y8IEDpnuk9pg-YQ__original/img/CsL_lBUjQAzea5WF1cMfvE1eKzs=/0x0/pic3771570.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: Carson City (Nevada, USA)"], "categories": ["Zombies"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Alexandre Droit", "Florent Toscano"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Jeux Opla"], "description": "You will have to free the animals, kill the mutants and the stubs of other teams, but above all do not forget to survive!\n\nApocalypse au Zoo de Carson City is composed of a square of 25 decks of two cards, corresponding to the zoo.

They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the \u2018Imascheren\u2019 (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.\n\nThe game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.\n\nThe display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).\n\nThe winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "189661", "name": "Targi: The Action Tokens"}, {"id": "202453", "name": "Targi: The Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 13750, "average": 7.64588, "bayesaverage": 7.41956, "stddev": 1.0924, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21325, "trading": 205, "wanting": 891, "wishing": 4361, "numcomments": 2383, "numweights": 475, "averageweight": 2.3453, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 122}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 94}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 128, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 83}, "2": {"best_rating": 120, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 88}}}, "usersrated": 13750.0, "average": 7.64588, "bayesaverage": 7.41956, "stddev": 1.0924, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21325.0, "trading": 205.0, "wanting": 891.0, "wishing": 4361.0, "numcomments": 2383.0, "numweights": 475.0, "averageweight": 2.3453, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 122}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 94}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "118247", "name": "Lucky Numbers", "alternative_names": ["5 vor 12"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/254SXVeOngtdjf8SBFEUNg__thumb/img/p5QUKwH4OYDPwTj3H67qSLXTka0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5646606.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/254SXVeOngtdjf8SBFEUNg__original/img/6v73hLE7PrYK-SXst2UM5eTQwJI=/0x0/pic5646606.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Series: Einfach Spielen (Ravensburger)"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Number"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Michael Schacht"], "artists": ["Christine Alcouffe", "Walter Pepperle"], "publishers": ["Ravensburger", "TIKI Editions Inc."], "description": "Your challenge in Lucky Numbers is to fill your grid first, but you never know which tiles you'll have to work with!\n\nTo set up, take a set of tiles numbered 1-20 for each player in the game, then shuffle all of these tiles face down. Each player has a 4x4 grid, and to complete set up, each player takes four tiles at random, then places them in order from low to high down the diagonal that goes from upper left to lower right.\n\nOn a turn, you take either a face-down tile from the pile or a face-up tile from the table. You can (1) place this tile in an empty space in your grid, (2) swap this tile for a tile already in the grid, or (3) discard this tile face-up on the table. However, all tiles in your grid must obey one rule at all times: A tile must be higher in value that any tile directly above it or to its immediate left and lower in value that any tile directly below it or to its immediate right. Whoever first fills their grid with sixteen tiles wins. (If the draw pile runs out, then whoever has the most tiles in their grid wins.)\n\nYou can play Lucky Numbers tournament style by playing multiple games and having each player start once. The winner of a game receives 2 points, while each loser receives -1 point for each empty space in their grid.

In their quest for power (points), players build Ziggurats (permanent outposts), wells, make sacrifices to gods and try to get along with nobles of Assur - the capital of Assyria. The game is a light-weight eurogame, built around the short-term rapid point gains vs long-term investments dilemma. General flow of play is as follows:\n\nPhase 1: Players get resources for expansion and decide on play order\n\nIn this phase, players pick cards with resources that enable expansion on the board. In general he/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.\n\nPhase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.\n\nPlayers begin to form strings and/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).\n\nPhase 3: Players spend money/camels on various investments.\n\nA player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.\n\nThe game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles. After each era comes the flood: the board is partially cleaned up, but players also capitalize on their investments from phase 3. Each round, players also score points for huts (those built on fertile land between the two rivers bring more points) and ziggurat tiles.\n\nIn comparison to other games from Ystari's series - Assyria is lighter than Caylus, Olympos, Ys or Sylla (in terms of complexity, available choices - represented by numerous tiles, cards, icons, cards etc. that need to be remembered and can be combined during play), but heavier than Yspahan, Mykerinos or Metropolis.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2009, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 1577, "average": 6.85965, "bayesaverage": 6.18226, "stddev": 1.26219, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2126, "trading": 136, "wanting": 67, "wishing": 285, "numcomments": 487, "numweights": 135, "averageweight": 3.0074, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1726}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 842}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 42, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "2": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "3": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 29, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 21}}}, "usersrated": 1577.0, "average": 6.85965, "bayesaverage": 6.18226, "stddev": 1.26219, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2126.0, "trading": 136.0, "wanting": 67.0, "wishing": 285.0, "numcomments": 487.0, "numweights": 135.0, "averageweight": 3.0074, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1726}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 842}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "17691", "name": "Djambi", "alternative_names": ["El candidato", "Chess of Machiavelli", "L'\u00e9chiquier de Machiavel"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0TL93TcrpLTJRvnfaV3BNQ__thumb/img/hmwSVZVHMc-Ur01fvZSUpdZcAKE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic122970.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0TL93TcrpLTJRvnfaV3BNQ__original/img/yrSKZSjeDyv-29IPxc5cDKyutNM=/0x0/pic122970.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Political"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": [], "designers": ["Jean Anesto"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["L'Impens\u00e9 Radical", "Morize Chavet", "Salvador Gadea SA (Gadea Games)"], "description": "Djambi, or Chess of Machiavelli is a game for 4 players that can be played with only 3.

The taken piece is placed on any other adjacent free square of the board, dead.\n\nThe Journalist kills a piece that is adjacent to any one of the 4 squares that share a common border with its square.

Through simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the strategic action without a myriad of complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.\n\nAs one gamer put it, \"It is a delight to be spending my limited brain power on making (or agonizing over) operational decisions that are as dependent upon guts as they are gray matter. This game is not a series of arithmetic exercises, and the only variable in these algorithms is nerve.\"\n\nThough the focus is on the big picture, Unconditional Surrender! still delivers historical detail. Each country has an historical army level order of battle, and its relative economic strength and national will to fight are effectively and simply modeled. Also represented are such World War II events as airdrops, Free Forces, jets, naval evacuation, partisans, radar, railroad artillery guns, and ULTRA; all neatly woven into the game's core mechanics for ease of play\n\nThe game has many scenarios ranging from quick playing individual campaigns to longer ones covering up to the entire war.\n\nDesign Highlights\n\n     Scale: army, fleet, or air wing level units; 30-60 miles per hex; monthly turns \n     Players: 2-4\n     Playing Time: 30 minutes to 50 hours, depending on the scenario\n     Low On-Map Counter Density: The number of counters on the map is relatively low.\n     Simple Stacking: No more than one air, ground, convoy, or warship unit per hex.\n     No Factors on Counters: There are no combat or movement factors on counters.\n     Single Combat System: One combat resolution sequence and Combat Results Table covers all types of combat, yet the results differ for air/naval, ground, or strategic combat. \n     Integrated Movement/Combat System: Units move and fight in a combined activation. \n     \"Use it or Lose it\" Economic System: Simple math with minimal record keeping\n     Historical or Variable Entry: Units and events can enter play using an historical or variable time line. \n     Variable Politics: Most countries\u2019 belligerence and faction alliance is not predetermined.\n     Solitaire Friendly: Though not designed with solitaire rules, the mechanics easily allow one player to play the game.\n     PBEM Capable: The game can be played using PBEM software, but its mechanics require frequent exchanges.\n\n\n\n\nTIME SCALE:    Monthly Turns\nMAP SCALE:     30 to 40 miles per hex\nUNIT SCALE:     Army, Fleet or Wing\n\nDESIGNER: Salvatore Vasta\nDEVELOPER: Mark Dey\nMAP ART: Salvatore Vasta & Mark Simonitch\nCOUNTER ART: Charlie Kibler\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 3, "playingtime": 3000, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 3000, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 805, "average": 8.3116, "bayesaverage": 6.37785, "stddev": 1.4146, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2456, "trading": 33, "wanting": 135, "wishing": 708, "numcomments": 344, "numweights": 98, "averageweight": 3.7347, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1232}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 25}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 39, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 28, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2": {"best_rating": 25, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 20}}}, "usersrated": 805.0, "average": 8.3116, "bayesaverage": 6.37785, "stddev": 1.4146, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2456.0, "trading": 33.0, "wanting": 135.0, "wishing": 708.0, "numcomments": 344.0, "numweights": 98.0, "averageweight": 3.7347, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1232}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 25}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "1116", "name": "Oh Hell!", "alternative_names": ["Allir edr\u00fa", "Beredskap", "Blackout", "Boerenbridge", "Bust", "Chinees dekken", "Chinees poepen", "Crazy Bridge", "Elevator", "German Bridge", "Lupaus", "Nomination Whist", "Oh Heck", "Oh Hell", "Oh Pshaw", "Oh Shit!", "Planowanie", "Plump", "Pocha", "Podrida", "La Potxa", "Pronostieken", "Riki Tiki", "Rikiki", "Romanian Whist", "Seven Down", "Spite", "Swing 13", "T\u00eda", "Tips", "Tips", "To Hell and Back", "Up and Down the River"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q3j5xIGSTZzw_Nd7lEDPzw__thumb/img/Hh9LrGBFhot2KqTaHzYvlqXz8VI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic616572.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q3j5xIGSTZzw_Nd7lEDPzw__original/img/H6lK_BSZbO7WiRkPbQtv6oZqy5I=/0x0/pic616572.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Traditional Playing Cards"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Trick-taking"], "designers": ["Geoffrey Mott-Smith"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["(Public Domain)", "Cadaco", "Heraclio Fournier", "University Games"], "description": "Oh Hell! is a trick taking standard deck playing card game.

They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.\n\nNext comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).\n\nThese cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: \n- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) \n- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards\n- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. \n- Draw new cards\n\nEach player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the \"time track\" would move forward.\nIn addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the \"exchange rates\" of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.\n\nAt the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable).

The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. The five main actions are shown on the bottom part of the board:\n\n\n    Get resources with 1-3 dice, depending on the value of the resource (camels, pepper, silk, gold). The first player for each resource gets them for free; the later ones have to pay according to the value shown on the dice.\n\n\n\n    Take one resource of your choice and two camels. Each player sets the minimum value for the future dice.\n\n\n\n    Earn money, with any one die netting you five money.\n\n\n\n    Purchase orders: The value of one die unlocks the orders up to that number (shown on the spaces) and allows you to buy one or two of those orders. Orders are refreshed and placed at the beginning of each round. To fulfill an order, players have to spend resources for victory points, other resources, camels, and more.\n\n\n\n    Travel: Two dice are placed to unlock the distance that can be traveled on the upper part of the board, that is, the map. Here, the traveler piece of each player starts at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a traveler stops at a city, they place a marker there, giving them access to a different additional action for the rest of the game.\n\n\nAfter five rounds, the game ends with players receiving victory points for arriving in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having reached the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game; these points are added to the VPs gained during the game.\n\nAuf den Spuren von Marco Polo should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which had the same German title.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "232945", "name": "The Voyages of Marco Polo: Agents of Venice"}, {"id": "186554", "name": "The Voyages of Marco Polo: The New Characters"}, {"id": "249086", "name": "The Voyages of Marco Polo: The Secret Path of Marco Polo"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 100, "minplaytime": 40, "maxplaytime": 100, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 19600, "average": 7.88153, "bayesaverage": 7.68204, "stddev": 1.25701, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22019, "trading": 282, "wanting": 1015, "wishing": 4528, "numcomments": 2875, "numweights": 950, "averageweight": 3.1905, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 52}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 48}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 394, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 188}, "2": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 268, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "3": {"best_rating": 123, "recommended_rating": 193, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 212, "recommended_rating": 101, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 143}}}, "usersrated": 19600.0, "average": 7.88153, "bayesaverage": 7.68204, "stddev": 1.25701, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22019.0, "trading": 282.0, "wanting": 1015.0, "wishing": 4528.0, "numcomments": 2875.0, "numweights": 950.0, "averageweight": 3.1905, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 52}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 48}], "game_family": "The Voyages of Marco Polo", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "302238", "name": "Crazy Farmers and the Cl\u00f4tures \u00c9lectriques", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2E2-_ngK9NanODfuwJvcZQ__thumb/img/l-ZF18x6dhPLGeYa5jJ3Ug0PlgQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5250551.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2E2-_ngK9NanODfuwJvcZQ__original/img/ZZbkf82o8PKwIhPw1n43kGGN9Pk=/0x0/pic5250551.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Farming"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Enclosure"], "designers": ["J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Chassaing", "Quentin de Cagny"], "artists": ["Charl\u00e8ne Jean"], "publishers": ["The Freaky 42"], "description": "'Crazy Farmers And The Cl\u00f4tures Electriques' is a strong emerging strategy game (2p) which tends to be more lightweight and chaotic in 3-4p (better around a table with friends and a good drink in this mode).

Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target.

If you can play so your opponent is unable to go you get a free play anywhere on the board.\n\nUK Games Expo best abstract game winner.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 10, "minplaytime": 10, "maxplaytime": 10, "minage": 6, "stats": {"usersrated": 389, "average": 7.20979, "bayesaverage": 5.81253, "stddev": 1.3344, "median": 0.0, "owned": 415, "trading": 6, "wanting": 44, "wishing": 176, "numcomments": 129, "numweights": 35, "averageweight": 1.7143, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3507}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 109}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 8, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "2": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 4}}}, "usersrated": 389.0, "average": 7.20979, "bayesaverage": 5.81253, "stddev": 1.3344, "median": 0.0, "owned": 415.0, "trading": 6.0, "wanting": 44.0, "wishing": 176.0, "numcomments": 129.0, "numweights": 35.0, "averageweight": 1.7143, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3507}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 109}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "23228", "name": "Evo", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gC3vOm0RMgI13XPhKwbqYw__thumb/img/WGWYIayKrV0NMT5fd27ZtXLAO34=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic123228.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gC3vOm0RMgI13XPhKwbqYw__original/img/Vl_q3V-B3pBMRzsoUbIRUG8auJU=/0x0/pic123228.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Medieval"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Movement"], "designers": ["Giancarlo Rainelli"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Edicarton"], "description": "Summary and goal of the game\n\nTwo or four players compete in a shared, cross-shaped board, formed by a central part 8x8 square and four 8x2 \u201carms\u201d, attached on each side of the 8x8 square.\nThe object for each player is to capture an adversary Castle, an immobile piece of its own color on one of the 4 arms of the board (facing for two players).\nTo achieve this each player will make use of 8 pieces of his own color, initially placed in one of the arms of the cross, around his Castle. The Castle of each player sits in the nearest right corner of the board.\nThe first player that captures an adversary Castle (or conquers the last piece of one colour) wins , thus ending game.\n\nTurn action: movement and capture\n\nOn his turn, a player can move one of his square-shaped pieces. All the pieces (but the Castle, which as said before can not be moved) are equal to each other. Each of them can move in 4 diferent ways, according to the side of the piece facing \u201cnorth\u201d, north being defined as \u201cforward\u201d from the POV of the owner of the piece. So for example \u201cnorth\u201d for the player sitting on the east side of table will be westward, wile for the player sitting on the north side of the table it will be southward, and so on.\n\nOn his turn the player can move one of his pieces in one of these \n2 ways:\n    - just rotate the piece in place (thus changing the piece movement\n            type for the next time he will decide to move it);\n    - move the piece and then (optionally) rotate it;\n\nA player can capture other players' pieces by moving one of his piece on a square occupied by an opponent's piece. Pieces can never \u201cgo through\u201d or \u201cjump over\u201d other pieces, both of the same or different colours.\n\nEach piece can be oriented in four different ways (one per each side of the piece) enabling it to four different kind of movement.\n\nThe active roles is the one facing \u201cnorth\u201d.\n\nThese are the four roles a piece can assume:\n\n- Warrior:\n        it moves 1 square and can't go backwards, in other words it can\n        move to one of the 5 squares adjacent to it (W, NW, N, NE, E);\n- Blade:\n        it moves 1 or 2 square \u201cforward\u201d (N);\n- Catapult:\n        it can move up to 3 squares diagonally going only forward, as\n        usual (NE, NW);\n- Shield:\n        the only role that can go backwards, it can move up to 2 squares\n        going South or just 1 square going diagonally (SW or SE).\n\nBegining of the game\n\nThe first player to move will be the one opening the table. Then it will be the player on his left the one to move, and so on, going clockwise.\n\nWe advise you not to distract from what the other players do: you can lose the game even if an enemy don't conquer your Castle (one wins, all others lose).\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 0, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 27, "average": 5.92593, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 2.28807, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34, "trading": 4, "wanting": 2, "wishing": 6, "numcomments": 4, "numweights": 2, "averageweight": 1.5, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}}}, "usersrated": 27.0, "average": 5.92593, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 2.28807, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34.0, "trading": 4.0, "wanting": 2.0, "wishing": 6.0, "numcomments": 4.0, "numweights": 2.0, "averageweight": 1.5, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "125028", "name": "Colorpop", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I2UvLIuGzXaRUj-3ldKTUA__thumb/img/hJprCVMaZaWWeyGVThcdAn_3cK4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2404152.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I2UvLIuGzXaRUj-3ldKTUA__original/img/h3aOmTtisrpC7Jzy7FcvTIImpqc=/0x0/pic2404152.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Deduction", "Puzzle"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Pattern Building"], "designers": ["Lionel Borg"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)", "Gigamic", "Lautapelit.fi"], "description": "Colorpop seems like a video game brought to the board game world, complete with a cool gadget to mimic the work done by our digital overlords.\n\nThe game board consists of an inclined plastic holder that holds ten racks, with each rack holding ten colored tokens.

(A player can choose to make a joker any color, so she can include or exclude a joker as she wishes during her turn.) Any tokens that were above these will slide down inside the racks. The player keeps all the tokens removed.\n\nPlayers take turns removing tokens until either a player is eliminated from the game or no groups of two or more tokens remain.

The game board shows fourteen locations arranged so that each location touches a few others; each location has space for a suspect and crime tile. Shuffle the suspect tiles (12, plus two \"no suspect\") and the crime tiles (10, plus four \"no crime\"), then place one face up in each location. Each suspect, crime and location is included in a deck of evidence cards, and nine evidence cards are revealed.\n\nOn a turn, a player either places an investigator, chooses an evidence card, or attempts to solve her case. When you place an investigator in a location, the player to your right looks at his case cards, then places a disc on this space for each case card he holds that matches the suspect, crime or location in this space. Additionally, he places a cube on this space for each suspect, crime or location that's adjacent to this space.\n\nWhen you choose an evidence card, the player to your right places a disc on the matching tile if the card matches one of the case cards he holds, places a cube on the matching tile if this tile is adjacent to a tile matching one of the case cards he holds, or places nothing if you've made a wild-eyed guess and the tile isn't adjacent to anything.\n\nTo attempt to solve the case, you place a black token on your guesses.

A dead man can\u2019t be President, it\u2019s as simple as that.\n    The \"Ugly\" Way: If you suspect that your opponent is after your Governor, you can attempt to arrest them with your Sheriff. If a Sheriff can foil an assassination attempt and arrest the Hitman, his employer\u2019s reputation will be left in tatters.

Additionally, you must not only strategize in 2D, but also in 3D as you stack pieces atop one another in order to bypass your opponent's defenses or stop their advance.\n The goal in Biyi is simple: be the first to get one of your playing pieces into your opponent's nest. However, accomplishing said goal will require cunning and strategic thinking, as players may, on their turn, move either a single playing piece or a stack of them. When moving, these pieces can climb onto other pieces, slide across pieces, jump from piece to piece, or descend from atop a stack. To make achieving victory even more of a challenge, a river stands between you and your opponent's nest, and crossing it will require clever positioning of not only your own pieces, but also the opponent's.\n\nDo you have what it takes to slide, climb and fly your way to victory?\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2020, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 7, "stats": {"usersrated": 10, "average": 5.3, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 3.2573, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "wanting": 0, "wishing": 3, "numcomments": 2, "numweights": 2, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 2, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}}}, "usersrated": 10.0, "average": 5.3, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 3.2573, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 3.0, "numcomments": 2.0, "numweights": 2.0, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "10527", "name": "Gyges", "alternative_names": ["Gyg\u00e8s"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gvXWRDHK15xzcVyNZ60jdA__thumb/img/oVbQFXPMV1P1JWAlXnz-S0WPfXA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1316284.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gvXWRDHK15xzcVyNZ60jdA__original/img/zoATqETPUjbK1aj1eMCpYJLlQfg=/0x0/pic1316284.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Series: Classic (Gigamic)"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": ["Kang"], "mechanics": ["Grid Movement"], "designers": ["Claude Leroy"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Blue Orange (EU)", "Gigamic", "Giseh Verlag", "Swiss Games"], "description": "The object of Gyg\u00e8s is to move a piece to your opponent's last row.

Played with tournament rules, you cannot win on an opponent's mistake, but rather only by creating a situation in which your opponent cannot block multiple winning combinations.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1985, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 15, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 15, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 350, "average": 6.72011, "bayesaverage": 5.71102, "stddev": 1.64771, "median": 0.0, "owned": 391, "trading": 7, "wanting": 40, "wishing": 153, "numcomments": 119, "numweights": 21, "averageweight": 2.5238, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4586}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 180}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 9, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "2": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 7}}}, "usersrated": 350.0, "average": 6.72011, "bayesaverage": 5.71102, "stddev": 1.64771, "median": 0.0, "owned": 391.0, "trading": 7.0, "wanting": 40.0, "wishing": 153.0, "numcomments": 119.0, "numweights": 21.0, "averageweight": 2.5238, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4586}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 180}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "10789", "name": "Pitch", "alternative_names": ["All-Fours", "Auction Pitch", "California Jack", "High-Low Jack", "Nines-Fives Pitch", "Old Sledge", "Partnership Draw Pitch", "Setback", "Seven Up", "Smear", "Smudge"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DKhFONKj5v4r16gXJjAP6g__thumb/img/OnHSlksfYVIsQ0Wbq1skUdzUomg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic46533.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DKhFONKj5v4r16gXJjAP6g__original/img/Xt89g4pCvqA7rYgKAPVB5tzI5ZA=/0x0/pic46533.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Outplay", "Components: Traditional Playing Cards"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Trick-taking"], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["(Public Domain)", "Hasbro", "Parker Brothers"], "description": "Pitch, by whatever point-variant is played, is in the similar vein as Spades and Bridge as a trick taking game.  Play uses a standard deck of 52 cards.  Players partner with the player across from them and are each dealt 9 cards.\n\nThe bid begins to the dealer's left at a minimum of four points and goes around the table, with players increasing the bid based on what they think they can take; if everyone passes the bid, the dealer is required to take the bid at four.  The player who announces the highest bid takes the position of dealer/leader and calls the trump suit, which is the only suit of import in this game (excepting the jokers and the left bauer or off-jack [jack of the same color, but not the trump suit]).  All players, save the dealer, discard all the cards from their hands that are not of the trump suit and request enough cards from the remaining 18-card deck to bring their hand up to 6. (*Note: If a player mistakenly discards a trump card, or one of the three other special cards, it is a free-for-all to whomever notices and picks it up off the table first)  The remaining cards in the deck are given to the bid-winner/leader, who can pick through them one-by-one, and pass any remaining unseen cards to his partner, each of them discarding to 6 before play begins.\n\nPlay begins with the dealer/leader leading in the trump suit.  Play proceeds around the table, with the player playing the highest valued card taking the trick and leading the following trick.  Players may only play cards that are of the trump suit, other remaining cards are useless. If a player takes a trick and no longer has cards of the trump suit, that players is out, and the player to the left then begins the trick.  Cards are ranked from Ace to Two, with the Off-Jack, High Joker, and Low Joker respectively taking the positions between the Jack and Ten.\n\nPoints are accrued by teams for taking the point cards in the tricks they take, which for 10-point pitch are Ace, Jack, Off-Jack (Left Bauer), High Joker, Low Joker (one has to rank higher than the other for play continuity), Ten, Three, and Two.  All are worth a point apiece, except the three, which is worth three.  The two is retained by the player who played it for his or her team and is not taken along with the trick.\n\nBoth teams receive points for the point cards they take, unless the high-bidding team does not meet their bid goal, in which case they go \"set\" and lose their number of bid points instead of gaining.  Teams play to 52 points.\n\nAnother option to bidding played in some areas is to \"shoot the moon.\" Shooting the moon means taking all 10 points. If the bid is shoot the moon the bidding team advances their score to 52 if their score was above zero or to zero if their score was below zero. Failure to score all ten points constitutes loss of game.\n\n\nAnother version, playing for High, Low, Jack, and Game plays with hands of 6 cards.\n\nThere are four possible points in a hand:\n\nHigh: highest trump card in play \nLow: lowest trump card in play; this point is retained by the team that played it regardless of who takes the trick\nJack: Jack of trump, if in play\nGame: highest point total in tricks captured counting A - 4, K - 3, Q - 2, J - 1, and 10 - 10.\n\n\n        Variant - 6 point pitch: Jokers Add in high and low Jokers for a point each if in play. Their strength is between Jack and 10. They are always considered to be in the trump suit\n    \n\n\nStarting at the dealer's left, each player has one chance to bid, with a minimum bid of 2. Players can overbid a previous bid. The person who wins the bid gets to name trump. Dealer has to take the bid if everyone passes, so if you have a decent hand when your partner dealt, it's a good idea to put in a 2 bid if the first person didn't bid. Not only will your partner not get stuck, but the third person to bid won't get to take an easy 2 bid if they want it, and will have to go 3.\n\nIf you bid and don't make it, you go down that many points. You can make points if your opponents bid.\n\nAfter the bid and declaration of trump, some people allow trashing and getting up to 2 new cards.\n\nThe player who won the bid leads a trump card. After that, the person who won the previous trick leads. Players must follow the suit led if possible, or play any suit if not, and may trump in at any time. Highest card of the suit lead takes the trick, if no trump is played. If trump is played, highest trump takes it.\n\nFirst team to 21 points wins.\n\n\"Jersey Pitch\" adds the rule that the 5 of trump is worth 5 points.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1600, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 247, "average": 6.78676, "bayesaverage": 5.67805, "stddev": 1.77374, "median": 0.0, "owned": 184, "trading": 0, "wanting": 4, "wishing": 15, "numcomments": 101, "numweights": 22, "averageweight": 1.7727, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 5093}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 9, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 3}}}, "usersrated": 247.0, "average": 6.78676, "bayesaverage": 5.67805, "stddev": 1.77374, "median": 0.0, "owned": 184.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 4.0, "wishing": 15.0, "numcomments": 101.0, "numweights": 22.0, "averageweight": 1.7727, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 5093}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "42215", "name": "Tobago", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuC2C10_6QK84R45Mseojw__thumb/img/bfp4x8H9nzQJQyNf2amKyx1BqUs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic596625.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuC2C10_6QK84R45Mseojw__original/img/Ao7x7lkwA_GExCLsNV4eZ_sQyDE=/0x0/pic596625.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Trinidad and Tobago", "Theme: Archaeology / Paleontology", "Theme: Tropical", "Theme: Tropical Islands"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Deduction", "Exploration"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Deduction", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Hexagon Grid", "Modular Board", "Push Your Luck"], "designers": ["Bruce Allen"], "artists": ["Victor Boden"], "publishers": ["Zoch Verlag", "Competo / Marektoy", "The Game Master BV", "Gigamic", "Giochi Uniti", "KADABRA", "Mercurio", "Piatnik", "Rio Grande Games", "Stupor Mundi"], "description": "Tobago is an adventure game, in which the players possess different parts of treasure maps.

Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.\n\nEach turn, a player can play a new goblin, activate a goblin, draw cards, or pass. To activate a goblin or draw cards, players need to spend 1-2 activation tokens, with them having only two at the start of each battle. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.\n\nOnce all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles.

Their stories will go down in history.\n\nIn Signorie, you will play the role of a Signore, a Lord of one of the most prestigious families of the Renaissance. One at the time, players choose one die from a common pool. (Twenty dice in five colors are rolled at the beginning of each round.) You place it on your player board (your city) and perform one of the possible actions. The color of the chosen die determines the action, and the number on the die is a discount on the cost of the action.\n\nDuring a round, each player can perform up to four actions. At the end of the round, if the sum of a player's chosen dice is equal or lower than 13, he can obtain a reward.\n\nThe dice mechanism is easy and innovative and gives players a simple, but challenging choice.

The same year Hex appeared in the Danish newspaper Politiken under the name Polygon. Hein introduced the game to the readers on December 26, 1942 and during the following four months gave them a problem each day to begin with - eventually two days a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The solution would always appear in the following column. It was independently invented by mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version. They called their version Hex, and the name stuck. Hex has the simplest rules of almost any game: connect your color edges with a path of tokens of your color. There is also a \"swap rule\" (also known as a pie rule) which compensates for the inherent advantage of the first player.\n\nThere are a number of resources for Hex on the internet, including several real-time servers.

The deck consists of 40 cards, numbered 0-7 in five colors, with the colors ranked on the cards: purple (high), blue, green, yellow, red (low). Note that all 7s are higher than any 6, which are each higher than any 5, and so on.\n\nAt the start of a round, each player is dealt seven cards. Players pass 0-3 cards to their left or right neighbor depending on the round number. Players then predict the number of tricks they'll take by choosing a card in their hand and simultaneously revealing them. The player with the highest bid becomes start player for the round, and the color of that player's card indicates the trump suit for that round. These bidding cards are then returned to the players' hands.\n\nThe start player for a trick lays down a card, and each player must follow the lead by playing a card of the same color or number. If this isn't possible, they can play any card. The highest trump card played (if any) wins the trick; otherwise the highest card played that followed the lead (including number!) wins the trick. After seven tricks, the round ends. Making one's bid nets two points plus the number of tricks bid, while missing results in a loss of one point for every under- or over-trick. The player with the highest score after seven rounds wins.\n\nAn optional rule forbids the bids from summing to seven. If this occurs, the player with the highest bid scores one point, then the bid cards are set aside and players rebid from the cards remaining in hand. This process can repeat until the total of bids made does not equal seven.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 9, "stats": {"usersrated": 71, "average": 6.33944, "bayesaverage": 5.52795, "stddev": 1.44393, "median": 0.0, "owned": 174, "trading": 7, "wanting": 2, "wishing": 13, "numcomments": 25, "numweights": 9, "averageweight": 1.7778, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 12434}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}}}, "usersrated": 71.0, "average": 6.33944, "bayesaverage": 5.52795, "stddev": 1.44393, "median": 0.0, "owned": 174.0, "trading": 7.0, "wanting": 2.0, "wishing": 13.0, "numcomments": 25.0, "numweights": 9.0, "averageweight": 1.7778, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 12434}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "194594", "name": "Dice Forge", "alternative_names": ["Dice Forge: A sors kov\u00e1csai", "Kowale Losu", "\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u044b", "\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b8", "\u935b\u9ab0\u7269\u8a9e"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4BTVGQWO0M9ayxyku3FW6Q__thumb/img/BWNtptZ90Cutx39I3Celuvirt78=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3477004.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4BTVGQWO0M9ayxyku3FW6Q__original/img/2RZLNEGrkZxF9Napw_dnqEbbnl4=/0x0/pic3477004.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Dice with Icons", "Game: Dice Forge"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Mythology"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Random Production"], "designers": ["R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e"], "artists": ["Biboun"], "publishers": ["Libellud", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hobby Japan", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "Heroes, stand ready!

By playing your Hunt cards and using the mysterious powers of Artemia, you try to wear down the Hunted and assimilate them to the planet forever.\n\nNOT ALONE is a immersive, thematic card game, where you use guessing, bluffing, hand management, and just a pinch of deck-building to achieve your goal, which is survival for the Hunted... or total assimilation for the Creature!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "238130", "name": "Not Alone: Essen 2017 Promo Cards"}, {"id": "222738", "name": "Not Alone: Exploration"}, {"id": "222739", "name": "Not Alone: Sanctuary"}, {"id": "326077", "name": "Not Alone: Sanctuary \u2013 The Promo Cards"}, {"id": "228389", "name": "Not Alone: The Green Artefact Promo"}, {"id": "209698", "name": "Not Alone: The Red Artefact Promo"}, {"id": "232381", "name": "Not Alone: The Yellow Artefact Promo"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 7674, "average": 7.01985, "bayesaverage": 6.72696, "stddev": 1.27625, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11840, "trading": 272, "wanting": 214, "wishing": 1687, "numcomments": 1226, "numweights": 148, "averageweight": 1.9527, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 670}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 441}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 114, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 73}, "2": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 19, "not_recommended_rating": 59}, "3": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "4": {"best_rating": 54, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 54, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "6": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 40, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "7": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 21}, "7+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 51}}}, "usersrated": 7674.0, "average": 7.01985, "bayesaverage": 6.72696, "stddev": 1.27625, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11840.0, "trading": 272.0, "wanting": 214.0, "wishing": 1687.0, "numcomments": 1226.0, "numweights": 148.0, "averageweight": 1.9527, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 670}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 441}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "bga": true}, {"id": "138788", "name": "Dungeon Roll", "alternative_names": ["\u0421\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VCIkZVZVTH9qAP7-HsyIgQ__thumb/img/Sour93yTZ_kXB0j59dPIGJMhPuU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1585905.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VCIkZVZVTH9qAP7-HsyIgQ__original/img/ARfgy1sPz30eA5jCr3LX8H_nHAQ=/0x0/pic1585905.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler", "Creatures: Dragons", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Dungeon Roll", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: TMG Originals"], "categories": ["Dice", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Push Your Luck", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Chris Darden"], "artists": ["Eric J.

The Adventurer uses Champion, Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Thief, and Scroll faces on the Party Dice to defeat monsters such as oozes and skeletons, to claim treasure inside chests, and to revive downed companions with potions. The Adventurer claims treasure by taking a token at random from inside the treasure chest-shaped game box.\n\nAll this fighting in the dungeon is certain to attract the attention of the boss: The Dragon!\n\nWhen three or more Dragon faces appear on the Dungeon Dice, the Adventurer must battle the Dragon.

To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.\n\nThe players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.\n\nEach turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.\n\nAs new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "34410", "name": "Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2005, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 150, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 150, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 26562, "average": 7.77503, "bayesaverage": 7.60933, "stddev": 1.47445, "median": 0.0, "owned": 26527, "trading": 537, "wanting": 907, "wishing": 5227, "numcomments": 6096, "numweights": 3166, "averageweight": 3.8048, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 69}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 58}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 716, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 354}, "2": {"best_rating": 152, "recommended_rating": 341, "not_recommended_rating": 108}, "3": {"best_rating": 398, "recommended_rating": 227, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4": {"best_rating": 282, "recommended_rating": 298, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "5": {"best_rating": 75, "recommended_rating": 269, "not_recommended_rating": 214}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 319}}}, "usersrated": 26562.0, "average": 7.77503, "bayesaverage": 7.60933, "stddev": 1.47445, "median": 0.0, "owned": 26527.0, "trading": 537.0, "wanting": 907.0, "wishing": 5227.0, "numcomments": 6096.0, "numweights": 3166.0, "averageweight": 3.8048, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 69}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 58}], "game_family": "Caylus", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "18946", "name": "Just Desserts", "alternative_names": ["Desserts parfaits", "Mi postre favorito"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FVxhPbmq_zhu2wanXxbNNQ__thumb/img/UvvYjtXKlmyj62avWnqBChL575k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2453795.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FVxhPbmq_zhu2wanXxbNNQ__original/img/f7J1a3JrkFP3p3OJ-ihg7yF4QYk=/0x0/pic2453795.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Theme: Food / Cooking"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Set Collection"], "designers": ["Andrew Looney"], "artists": ["Brooke Allen", "Andrew Heath"], "publishers": ["Edge Entertainment", "Looney Labs"], "description": "The guests are here, and they're hungry, so try to be the best waiter at this caf\u00e9 by making sure that all the guests get their Just Desserts!\n\nIn this card game, each player starts with a hand of three dessert cards while three guest cards are placed in the center of the table; each dessert card shows 1-3 tastes that it satisfies, such as chocolate, fruit, or pastry, while the guest cards show what they crave as well as what they refuse to eat.

Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!\n\nTournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.\n\nIn each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!\n\nNote that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!\n\n\nGame Summary\nThere are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.\n\nOn your turn:\n\n     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. \n     Then take one action:\n         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.\n         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.\n         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.\n         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.\n    \n\n\n\n\nThe game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated. Most VP wins!\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 2896, "average": 7.01105, "bayesaverage": 6.48449, "stddev": 1.24636, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4193, "trading": 170, "wanting": 158, "wishing": 611, "numcomments": 767, "numweights": 208, "averageweight": 2.9038, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1031}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 569}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 71, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "2": {"best_rating": 39, "recommended_rating": 19, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "3": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 36, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 22}}}, "usersrated": 2896.0, "average": 7.01105, "bayesaverage": 6.48449, "stddev": 1.24636, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4193.0, "trading": 170.0, "wanting": 158.0, "wishing": 611.0, "numcomments": 767.0, "numweights": 208.0, "averageweight": 2.9038, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1031}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 569}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "105265", "name": "Battle of LITS", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/waT4v0kztXqe-tlc8_Adzg__thumb/img/wRwijLXI2nvBbGgxX1aXN4t1Rm4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2841184.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/waT4v0kztXqe-tlc8_Adzg__original/img/CUokODjNZWisWDnD-KQmHMpV8Jg=/0x0/pic2841184.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Components: Polyominoes", "Crowdfunding: nestorbooster"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Grant Fikes"], "artists": ["N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"], "publishers": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)", "nestorgames"], "description": "Battle of LITS is an abstract strategy game for 2 players, inspired by the Japanese logic puzzle LITS.

Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.\n\nAt the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "145148", "name": "Patronage (fan expansion for Race for the Galaxy)"}, {"id": "92932", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Alien Artifacts"}, {"id": "270439", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Das Erweiterungs-Bundle"}, {"id": "242309", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: New Worlds Promo"}, {"id": "40210", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Rebel vs Imperium"}, {"id": "268829", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Retrofit Cards"}, {"id": "66121", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: The Brink of War"}, {"id": "34499", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm"}, {"id": "161599", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Invasion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2007, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 45635, "average": 7.75988, "bayesaverage": 7.65738, "stddev": 1.48202, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54949, "trading": 1058, "wanting": 1104, "wishing": 8627, "numcomments": 9514, "numweights": 3445, "averageweight": 2.9808, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 57}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 55}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1056, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 96, "not_recommended_rating": 451}, "2": {"best_rating": 683, "recommended_rating": 272, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "3": {"best_rating": 333, "recommended_rating": 531, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "4": {"best_rating": 406, "recommended_rating": 415, "not_recommended_rating": 62}, "4+": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 92, "not_recommended_rating": 388}}}, "usersrated": 45635.0, "average": 7.75988, "bayesaverage": 7.65738, "stddev": 1.48202, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54949.0, "trading": 1058.0, "wanting": 1104.0, "wishing": 8627.0, "numcomments": 9514.0, "numweights": 3445.0, "averageweight": 2.9808, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 57}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 55}], "game_family": "Race for the Galaxy", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "bga": true}, {"id": "13928", "name": "Chinagold", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Gz0wx9Pk03eq-IW9b_Bi-Q__thumb/img/nfTgYPQut6hJmx5V6xgExcjixLI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic63271.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Gz0wx9Pk03eq-IW9b_Bi-Q__original/img/xtmIEQJoZNiAn43ruEvyPgKQErI=/0x0/pic63271.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "designers": ["G\u00fcnter Cornett"], "artists": ["Bernd Natke"], "publishers": ["Bambus Spieleverlag"], "description": "PLEASE don\u2018t post any rules or variants of this game or other from G\u00fcnter Cornett.

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.\n\nTaking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary.

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a \"home\" tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.\n\nIn spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.\n\nKeyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.\n\nKeyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the \"Key\" series from R&D Games set in the medieval \"Key\" land.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "256951", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018"}, {"id": "162647", "name": "Keyflower: Beekeeper"}, {"id": "245169", "name": "Keyflower: Boat 7"}, {"id": "264045", "name": "Keyflower: Delivery Man"}, {"id": "261369", "name": "Keyflower: Developer"}, {"id": "141816", "name": "Keyflower: Emporium & Monument"}, {"id": "140936", "name": "Keyflower: Key Celeste"}, {"id": "205504", "name": "Keyflower: Keymelequin"}, {"id": "180037", "name": "Keyflower: Pig Shelter"}, {"id": "245170", "name": "Keyflower: Sorcerer"}, {"id": "147380", "name": "Keyflower: Storyteller"}, {"id": "144058", "name": "Keyflower: The Farmers"}, {"id": "163572", "name": "Keyflower: The Merchants"}, {"id": "163742", "name": "Keyflower: Trader"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 18622, "average": 7.80783, "bayesaverage": 7.6243, "stddev": 1.30568, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21745, "trading": 317, "wanting": 1217, "wishing": 5761, "numcomments": 3359, "numweights": 878, "averageweight": 3.3462, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 65}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 54}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 350, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 146}, "2": {"best_rating": 60, "recommended_rating": 187, "not_recommended_rating": 41}, "3": {"best_rating": 114, "recommended_rating": 151, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4": {"best_rating": 188, "recommended_rating": 87, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 41, "recommended_rating": 141, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "6": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 110, "not_recommended_rating": 89}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 118}}}, "usersrated": 18622.0, "average": 7.80783, "bayesaverage": 7.6243, "stddev": 1.30568, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21745.0, "trading": 317.0, "wanting": 1217.0, "wishing": 5761.0, "numcomments": 3359.0, "numweights": 878.0, "averageweight": 3.3462, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 65}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 54}], "game_family": "Keyflower", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "bga": true}, {"id": "71074", "name": "Expedition: Northwest Passage", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xMxqoz3tQjDhkV3QLqMHIQ__thumb/img/bsJNc4Bn7kf_LMfdxO-wjWuOJNA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1681453.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xMxqoz3tQjDhkV3QLqMHIQ__original/img/jo--4KfosITHTWERE6sfKUK2F6g=/0x0/pic1681453.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Canada", "Organizations: Forgenext", "Organizations: The Game Artisans of Canada", "Region: Arctic"], "categories": ["Exploration", "Nautical", "Racing"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Map Addition", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Yves Tourigny"], "artists": ["St\u00e9phane Poinsot", "Yves Tourigny"], "publishers": ["Matagot", "(Web published)", "Asmodee"], "description": "In 1845, Sir John Franklin led an expedition on behalf of the British Royal Navy to find and explore the last portion of the Northwest Passage, regardless of the cost.

They left England in May and encountered whalers along the west coast of Greenland in August. There, they waited for more favorable weather conditions for the crossing of the Lancaster Sound. Once the weather improved, they sailed into unknown waters, and no one ever heard from them again...\n\nTheir disappearance provoked a great deal of turmoil in public opinion, and numerous British and American expeditions attempted to find their trail.

The game is based on Schafkopf, Ombre (bidding) and Tarock (remaining cards). The latest revision of rules as approved by both the International Skat Players Association (ISPA) and the German Skat Association (DSkV) dates back to 1998.\n\nA play comprises two phases: first an intricate bidding process to decide the solo player who choses the type of game to be played in the second phase, the actual playing of tricks. If he wins (takes more than half the total worth of cards in the game), the solo player alone will score points equal to the announced type of game and other modifiers (listed below); otherwise, the other two players will each score the double amount of these points. Both the bid and the final score depend on \n\n     type of game announced\n     combination of Jacks\n     margin of winning (score 90+: \"schneider\"; take all tricks: \"schwarz\")\n     (optional) declaration of margin of winning before the first trick is played \n     (optional) open play of cards\n     (optional) play with the initial hand (\"hand\" play)\n     (optional) doubling of scoring value: *2 (\"Kontra\"); re-doubling *4 (\"Re\"); inofficial rules allow re-doubling ad infinitum\n     exeption for the Ramsch variant including sub-variants: Highest total worth of cards taken as tricks is scored negatively; the score is doubled when one other player took no trick (\"virgin\"), also doubled for each passing of the remaining cards without exchanging, if the drafting Ramsch variant is applied (\"geschoben\"); a player may also try to \"shoot the moon\" by taking all tricks (consequently scores +120 alone when successful).\n\n\n\n\nThe solo player can choose between the following game modes:\n\n     Suit (one suit and Jacks are trumps)\n     Grand (only Jacks are trumps)\n     Null (no trumps, solo player only wins without tricks). \n\n\n\n\nInofficial variants:\n\n     The most popular variant is Ramsch, which is applied when no player bids for the solo. This game mode punishes players who likely avoid the risk of successfully bidding for the solo with an only mediocre, but possible hand. It follows the rules for Grand, but highest score loses (no partnerships!). Due to the sometimes extraorinarily high (negative) scores, Ramsch plays may strongly distort a player's total scoring for the evening, and is therefore not officially sanctioned.\n     Revolution (in three variants): bascially a Null in open play, but the counterplayers are allowed to exchange cards.\n\n\n\n\nSkat gained nation wide popularity and a major development of its mechanisms in the course of the first world war. The game as it is today is a result of constant modification and refinement by countless players in the trenches of the German Western front. The current form of bidding with ascending numbers prevailed among the players, and many inofficial variants were introduced. Though first rejected by the Skat association, a lot of the so-called \"trench rules\" later became officially sanctioned.\n\nThe official turnament deck is a compomise that solved another dispute between the German and the International Skat Association by combining the colours of a German Suit (predominantly found in Southern and East Germany, Switzerland, Austria) with the symbols of a French Suit (predominant elsewhere in the regions where Skat is popular, foremost Northern and West Germany).\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1810, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 3, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 967, "average": 7.26418, "bayesaverage": 6.14948, "stddev": 1.74355, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1370, "trading": 10, "wanting": 15, "wishing": 91, "numcomments": 284, "numweights": 101, "averageweight": 3.0693, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1833}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 885}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 34, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "3": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 18, "not_recommended_rating": 10}}}, "usersrated": 967.0, "average": 7.26418, "bayesaverage": 6.14948, "stddev": 1.74355, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1370.0, "trading": 10.0, "wanting": 15.0, "wishing": 91.0, "numcomments": 284.0, "numweights": 101.0, "averageweight": 3.0693, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1833}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 885}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "6887", "name": "Hearts", "alternative_names": ["Bicycle Enhanced Playing Cards", "Bicycle Jacked Up!

Position the Flagship in tactical orbit! And reconfigure that Battlestation into something new! Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.\n\nIn Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.\n\nEach type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.\n\nYou win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.\n\nWith elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.\n\nQuantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "188030", "name": "Quantum: Entanglement Add-on Pack"}, {"id": "149799", "name": "Quantum: The Void"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 6432, "average": 7.28742, "bayesaverage": 6.9082, "stddev": 1.39276, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7544, "trading": 181, "wanting": 612, "wishing": 2668, "numcomments": 1225, "numweights": 253, "averageweight": 2.4466, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 475}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 301}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 116, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 64}, "2": {"best_rating": 28, "recommended_rating": 51, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "3": {"best_rating": 38, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 64, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 52}}}, "usersrated": 6432.0, "average": 7.28742, "bayesaverage": 6.9082, "stddev": 1.39276, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7544.0, "trading": 181.0, "wanting": 612.0, "wishing": 2668.0, "numcomments": 1225.0, "numweights": 253.0, "averageweight": 2.4466, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 475}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 301}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "bga": true}, {"id": "98426", "name": "Super Tock 6", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8a6_5jcQ7X46EIKFEeyW9g__thumb/img/0Tupf56NNnizU2Vjt4x2tvJGl3s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic989128.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8a6_5jcQ7X46EIKFEeyW9g__original/img/jeC8GW5b8KzGh0a9eiuI4vMW4Ug=/0x0/pic989128.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Marbles", "Game: Super Tock", "Traditional Games: Pachisi / Ludo"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Racing"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": [], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Jouets Bo-Jeux Toys"], "description": "This game is a variant of \"Super Tock 4\" (or four-player Pacheesi.)

For example, the more you Research, the better you get at Researching (because you'll have more Research cards in your deck).\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "177849", "name": "Eminent Domain: Base Game Scenarios Promo"}, {"id": "86780", "name": "Eminent Domain: Bonus Planets"}, {"id": "168586", "name": "Eminent Domain: Cygnus Planet Promo"}, {"id": "110863", "name": "Eminent Domain: Elusive/Exclusive Victory Promo"}, {"id": "136313", "name": "Eminent Domain: Escalation"}, {"id": "163639", "name": "Eminent Domain: Exotica"}, {"id": "232135", "name": "Eminent Domain: Oblivion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 9410, "average": 7.05101, "bayesaverage": 6.82642, "stddev": 1.32873, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12430, "trading": 655, "wanting": 314, "wishing": 2050, "numcomments": 2330, "numweights": 524, "averageweight": 2.5057, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 544}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 355}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 134, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 64}, "2": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 69, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "3": {"best_rating": 73, "recommended_rating": 45, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 31, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 56}}}, "usersrated": 9410.0, "average": 7.05101, "bayesaverage": 6.82642, "stddev": 1.32873, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12430.0, "trading": 655.0, "wanting": 314.0, "wishing": 2050.0, "numcomments": 2330.0, "numweights": 524.0, "averageweight": 2.5057, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 544}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 355}], "game_family": "Eminent Domain", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "68448", "name": "7 Wonders", "alternative_names": ["7 csoda", "7 Cud\u00f3w \u015awiata", "7 div\u016f sv\u011bta", "7 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441", "7 \u0e2a\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e28\u0e08\u0e23\u0e23\u0e22\u0e4c", "7 \uc6d0\ub354\uc2a4", "\u03a4\u03b1 7 \u03b8\u03b1\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5", "\u4e03\u5927\u5947\u8e5f", "\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u4e03\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RvFVTEpnbb4NM7k0IF8V7A__thumb/img/ZlG_SRFChObHenw79fAve56_mnk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic860217.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RvFVTEpnbb4NM7k0IF8V7A__original/img/3DP_RW5lTX0WrV67s8qi8CsiXoQ=/0x0/pic860217.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: 7 Wonders", "Mechanism: Tableau Building"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "City Building", "Civilization", "Economic"], "implementations": ["7 Wonders (Second Edition)", "7 Wonders Duel"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Antoine Bauza"], "artists": ["Miguel Coimbra"], "publishers": ["Repos Production", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hobby Japan", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "NeoTroy Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Siam Board Games"], "description": "You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.\n\n7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.\n\nIn essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.\n\nThough the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3\u20137 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "247315", "name": "7 Wonders: Armada"}, {"id": "154638", "name": "7 Wonders: Babel"}, {"id": "110308", "name": "7 Wonders: Catan"}, {"id": "111661", "name": "7 Wonders: Cities"}, {"id": "92539", "name": "7 Wonders: Leaders"}, {"id": "83445", "name": "7 Wonders: Manneken Pis"}, {"id": "133993", "name": "7 Wonders: Wonder Pack"}, {"id": "164649", "name": "Collection (fan expansion for 7 Wonders)"}, {"id": "140098", "name": "Empires (fan expansion for 7 Wonders)"}, {"id": "138187", "name": "Game Wonders (fan expansion for 7 Wonders)"}, {"id": "134849", "name": "Lost Wonders (fan expansion for 7 Wonders)"}, {"id": "131947", "name": "More Wonders...

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?\n\nIn Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:\n\n\n    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.\n    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!\n\n\nThe game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.\n\nEach player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items \u2014 but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.\n\nEach player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.\n\nYou can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.\n\nAt the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "191779", "name": "Brettspiel Easter Basket 2016"}, {"id": "255347", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Belle"}, {"id": "255348", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Cheyenne"}, {"id": "255349", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Django"}, {"id": "255350", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Doc"}, {"id": "255351", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Ghost"}, {"id": "255352", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Tuco"}, {"id": "213850", "name": "Colt Express: Cursed Loot"}, {"id": "181158", "name": "Colt Express: Horses & Stagecoach"}, {"id": "189394", "name": "Colt Express: Le tunnel avant l'arriv\u00e9e en gare"}, {"id": "191865", "name": "Colt Express: Marshal & Prisoners"}, {"id": "189189", "name": "Colt Express: North Pole Station"}, {"id": "302242", "name": "Colt Express: Promo Cards"}, {"id": "290189", "name": "Colt Express: The Santa Claus Elf"}, {"id": "186064", "name": "Colt Express: The Time Travel Car"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 40, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 40, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 23941, "average": 7.13115, "bayesaverage": 6.99817, "stddev": 1.23591, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33417, "trading": 578, "wanting": 449, "wishing": 3296, "numcomments": 3691, "numweights": 799, "averageweight": 1.8185, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 381}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 85}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 341, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 226}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 38, "not_recommended_rating": 223}, "3": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 169, "not_recommended_rating": 94}, "4": {"best_rating": 107, "recommended_rating": 187, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "5": {"best_rating": 212, "recommended_rating": 79, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "6": {"best_rating": 178, "recommended_rating": 101, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "6+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 129}}}, "usersrated": 23941.0, "average": 7.13115, "bayesaverage": 6.99817, "stddev": 1.23591, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33417.0, "trading": 578.0, "wanting": 449.0, "wishing": 3296.0, "numcomments": 3691.0, "numweights": 799.0, "averageweight": 1.8185, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 381}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 85}], "game_family": "Colt Express", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 16, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "25613", "name": "Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization", "alternative_names": ["Cywilizacja: Poprzez wieki", "Im Wandel der Zeiten: Eine Geschichte der Zivilisation", "Through the Ages: Historia de las Civilizaciones", "Through the Ages: L'Histoire vous appartient", "Through the Ages: La Storia delle Civilt\u00e0", "Through the Ages: P\u0159\u00edb\u011bh civilizace", "\u6b77\u53f2\u5de8\u8f2a / \u5386\u53f2\u5de8\u8f6e", "\uc4f0\ub8e8 \ub514 \uc5d0\uc774\uc9c0\uc2a4: \uc778\ub958 \ubb38\uba85 \ubc1c\uc804 \ub300\uc11c\uc0ac\uc2dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3piN3YX4WmBRuIvbEG2Ygg__thumb/img/TDXIygWwAHKc2o90uGnnAhIa7_4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic236169.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3piN3YX4WmBRuIvbEG2Ygg__original/img/xeBBIO9BN7HGMxQdTw5zk5Hxou8=/0x0/pic236169.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Through the Ages", "Mechanism: Tableau Building"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Economic"], "implementations": ["Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Auction/Bidding", "Auction: Dutch", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "designers": ["Vlaada Chv\u00e1til"], "artists": ["Richard Cortes", "Paul Niemeyer"], "publishers": ["Czech Board Games", "Czech Games Edition", "DiceTree Games", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "HomoLudicus", "IELLO", "MINDOK", "Pegasus Spiele", "Portal Games", "Raven Distribution", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "description": "Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "98989", "name": "BGO Extended 2.0 expansion (fan expansion for Through the Ages)"}, {"id": "98607", "name": "Cywilizacja: Poprzez wieki \u2013 Polski dodatek 1"}, {"id": "98608", "name": "Cywilizacja: Poprzez wieki \u2013 Polski dodatek 2"}, {"id": "98880", "name": "Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization \u2013 Czech expansion"}, {"id": "136095", "name": "Through the Ages: Spanish Promo Card Set"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2006, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 17867, "average": 7.93599, "bayesaverage": 7.72568, "stddev": 1.68158, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17337, "trading": 925, "wanting": 634, "wishing": 4229, "numcomments": 3984, "numweights": 1801, "averageweight": 4.1749, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 44}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 36}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 671, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 295}, "2": {"best_rating": 165, "recommended_rating": 355, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "3": {"best_rating": 430, "recommended_rating": 161, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "4": {"best_rating": 122, "recommended_rating": 256, "not_recommended_rating": 175}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 283}}}, "usersrated": 17867.0, "average": 7.93599, "bayesaverage": 7.72568, "stddev": 1.68158, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17337.0, "trading": 925.0, "wanting": 634.0, "wishing": 4229.0, "numcomments": 3984.0, "numweights": 1801.0, "averageweight": 4.1749, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 44}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 36}], "game_family": "Through the Ages", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "25674", "name": "Khronos", "alternative_names": ["Les crois\u00e9s du Temps", "\ud06c\ub85c\ub178\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/38UliyiXQuYP7YuBxy-YtQ__thumb/img/Aoj7lu1JtC-aYOSFUb9vRCmtAAM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1195438.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/38UliyiXQuYP7YuBxy-YtQ__original/img/WRfD8W4wXKsmw46Ch39Vc5rFuMQ=/0x0/pic1195438.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Theme: Steampunk", "Theme: Time Travel"], "categories": ["City Building", "Fantasy", "Medieval", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Hand Management", "Multiple Maps", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Arnaud Urbon", "Ludovic Vialla"], "artists": ["Jean-Claude Adelmand", "Geoffrey Stepourenko"], "publishers": ["Matagot", "Boosterbox.nl", "Edge Entertainment", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "In this game, you play a powerful lord and his faithful companion engaged in a fight for influence throughout time. The game proceeds simultaneously over three different periods. You start the game in the Middle Ages, on the first of the three game boards (that of the commanderies). With 4 action cards in hand per turn, you have seven turns in which to develop your domains by building various types of military, religious, and civil buildings. Depending on their size, certain buildings are moved in time, which means that they are transferred to the same place on the priories board (Renaissance period) and on the brotherhoods board (modern period), in ruins for military and religious buildings (castles, abbeys\u2026).\n\nThanks to the watch makers' invention, and with enough money, you can make your two adventurer pawns travel in time\u2026 Because if the construction of certain buildings can be profitable, taking over domains on the various boards is essential, since it will allow you to earn bonuses on the 4th and 7th turns and to move ahead of your opponents.\n\nPlaying with time is not without consequences, and it can produce surprising results! To give just one example, an abbey created on the priories board could be destroyed by a castle built later in the game in the same place but on the commanderies board, and then moved to the other board\u2026 The abbey finally never existed!\n\nOn the 4th and 7th turns, each controlled domain generates profits for the players depending on the board. On the the commanderies board, a player who controls a domain militarily, i.e. the one with the biggest military building, will receive the value of the civil buildings in this domain in profits. On the priories board, it is the religious control that will be taken into account. On the brotherhoods board, the players who have best populated the civil buildings and restored the ruins will secure the best profits.\n\nThe possibility of destroying and regrouping buildings to unite or divide domains provides a strong and permanent level of interaction between the players.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2006, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 1756, "average": 6.35458, "bayesaverage": 5.95006, "stddev": 1.47876, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2507, "trading": 173, "wanting": 92, "wishing": 386, "numcomments": 622, "numweights": 216, "averageweight": 3.5648, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2661}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1201}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 33, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "3": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 14}}}, "usersrated": 1756.0, "average": 6.35458, "bayesaverage": 5.95006, "stddev": 1.47876, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2507.0, "trading": 173.0, "wanting": 92.0, "wishing": 386.0, "numcomments": 622.0, "numweights": 216.0, "averageweight": 3.5648, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2661}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1201}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": "25821", "name": "The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow", "alternative_names": ["Het Beste van Weerwolven van Wakkerdam", "Els Homes Llop de Vallnegra", "Els Homes Llop de Vallnegra", "Los Hombres Lobo de Castronegro", "Os Lobisomens d'Aldeia Velha", "Les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux", "Les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux \"Ten Years After\"", "Lupi Mannari di Roccascura", "Varulv fra Theircelieux", "Varulvarna i Kl\u00e5gerup", "V\u00e9rfarkasok Miller's Hollow-ban", "De Weerwolven van Wakkerdam", "De Weerwolven van Wakkerdam Jubileumeditie", "Werewolves of Miller's Hollow", "Die Werw\u00f6lfe von D\u00fcsterwald", "Wilko\u0142aki ze Srebrnej G\u00f3ry", "\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba\u30db\u30ed\u30a6\u306e\u4eba\u72fc", "\u7c73\u52d2\u5c71\u8c37\u72fc\u4eba"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gBxf-8tL9SnYglYY7dEpJA__thumb/img/ck7BwZGnHTFG6uCEUZdWndXjxAk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic510856.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gBxf-8tL9SnYglYY7dEpJA__original/img/wdSMpOFfty85DOnIY9GR5hL2YB0=/0x0/pic510856.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Werewolf / Mafia"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Horror", "Murder/Mystery", "Party Game"], "implementations": ["Best of Werewolves of Miller's Hollow"], "mechanics": ["Player Elimination", "Role Playing", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "designers": ["Philippe des Palli\u00e8res", "Herv\u00e9 Marly"], "artists": ["Philippe des Palli\u00e8res", "Herv\u00e9 Marly", "Alexios Tjoyas"], "publishers": ["Lui-m\u00eame", "999 Games", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Cr\u00f3mola", "f\u00f6rlAgo AB", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Granna", "Hobby Japan", "Morapiaf", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a game that takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves.

There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is \"lynched\", reveals his/her role and is out of the game.
