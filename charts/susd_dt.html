Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "279645", "name": "Unmatched: Bruce Lee"}, {"id": "284779", "name": "Unmatched: Jurassic Park \u2013 Grant"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2020, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 40, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 40, "minage": 9, "stats": {"usersrated": 438, "average": 8.35135, "bayesaverage": 6.10418, "stddev": 1.13996, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1542, "trading": 10, "wanting": 142, "wishing": 491, "numcomments": 91, "numweights": 6, "averageweight": 1.8333, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1978}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 4, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "2": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 2}}}, "usersrated": 438.0, "average": 8.35135, "bayesaverage": 6.10418, "stddev": 1.13996, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1542.0, "trading": 10.0, "wanting": 142.0, "wishing": 491.0, "numcomments": 91.0, "numweights": 6.0, "averageweight": 1.8333, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1978}], "game_family": "Unmatched", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "284818", "name": "Caylus 1303", "alternative_names": ["\ucf00\uc77c\ub7ec\uc2a4 1303"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AmDxG1Bbkr4cNC2d8XO-7A__thumb/img/MZ0JIjoGOhvDb8fG1IO8hn03768=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4978911.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AmDxG1Bbkr4cNC2d8XO-7A__original/img/l9ndzo98AxRoUeFeZmYMR7Kery4=/0x0/pic4978911.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: France", "Game: Caylus"], "categories": ["City Building", "Economic", "Medieval"], "implementations": ["Caylus"], "mechanics": ["Worker Placement"], "designers": ["William Attia"], "artists": ["Andrew Bosley"], "publishers": ["Space Cowboys", "DiceTree Games", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "HUCH!", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "A classic game is back!

It's also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach.

Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.\n\nAs in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.\n\nEach round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):\n\n1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.\n2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.\n3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.\n4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.\n5) Loan - Take a \u00a330 loan and reduce your income.\n\nBrass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:\n\n6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)\n\nThe game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.\n\nBirmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.\n\nIron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.\n\nNew \"Sell\" system\n\nBrewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also \"grease the wheels of industry\" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.\n\nBirmingham features three all-new industry types:\n\nBrewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.\n\nManufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.\n\nPottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.\n\nIncreased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to \u00a38 per cube, and it's not uncommon.\n\nBrass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 17355, "average": 8.65531, "bayesaverage": 8.35294, "stddev": 1.26242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25741, "trading": 67, "wanting": 1375, "wishing": 8921, "numcomments": 2751, "numweights": 812, "averageweight": 3.9101, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 3}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 406, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 204}, "2": {"best_rating": 45, "recommended_rating": 250, "not_recommended_rating": 44}, "3": {"best_rating": 212, "recommended_rating": 124, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 185, "recommended_rating": 130, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 164}}}, "usersrated": 17355.0, "average": 8.65531, "bayesaverage": 8.35294, "stddev": 1.26242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25741.0, "trading": 67.0, "wanting": 1375.0, "wishing": 8921.0, "numcomments": 2751.0, "numweights": 812.0, "averageweight": 3.9101, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 3}], "game_family": "Brass", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "224783", "name": "Vindication", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kEIlWY3rg27NgmVBZkFyg__thumb/img/NYzya2nOQJaZolgQGxKXiBd_O6g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4101638.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kEIlWY3rg27NgmVBZkFyg__original/img/IaeMjblsJR_kI9lP3M7LWTcZnTE=/0x0/pic4101638.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Game Trayz Inside", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "categories": ["Fantasy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hexagon Grid", "Modular Board", "Variable Phase Order"], "designers": ["Marc Neidlinger"], "artists": ["Noah Adelman", "Brett Carville", "Emiliano Cordoba", "Bartek Fedyczak", "Noemi Konkoly", "Phu Thieu"], "publishers": ["Orange Nebula, LLC"], "description": "Vindication (formerly Epoch: The Awakening) is a highly strategic, fantasy-based tabletop journey for 2-5 players.

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.\n\nThe game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.\n\nEach round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.\n\nIf they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.\n\nThe player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.\n\nThe game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.\n\nWelcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "211083", "name": "Welcome Back to the Dungeon: Easter Egg"}, {"id": "193533", "name": "Welcome to the Dungeon: Toad Promo"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 11450, "average": 6.61004, "bayesaverage": 6.4631, "stddev": 1.20268, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20136, "trading": 565, "wanting": 145, "wishing": 1483, "numcomments": 1963, "numweights": 313, "averageweight": 1.2268, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1065}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 83}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 315}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 145, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 94}, "2": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 82, "not_recommended_rating": 29}, "3": {"best_rating": 95, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 53, "recommended_rating": 60, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 79}}}, "usersrated": 11450.0, "average": 6.61004, "bayesaverage": 6.4631, "stddev": 1.20268, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20136.0, "trading": 565.0, "wanting": 145.0, "wishing": 1483.0, "numcomments": 1963.0, "numweights": 313.0, "averageweight": 1.2268, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1065}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 83}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 315}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "150376", "name": "Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game", "alternative_names": ["Dead of Winter: A la crois\u00e9e des chemins", "Dead of Winter: Edizione Italiana", "Dead of Winter: Um Jogo de Encruzilhadas", "Dead of Winter: Un Juego de Encrucijadas", "Holtak tele: V\u00e1lasz\u00faton", "Martwa Zima: Gra rozdro\u017cy", "Winter der Toten: Ein Spiel mit dem Schicksal", "Zima Mrtv\u00fdch: Cesty Osudu", "\u041c\u0451\u0440\u0442\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0451\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0438", "\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c\u0e21\u0e23\u0e13\u0e30", "\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc", "\u6b7b\u4ea1\u5bd2\u51ac", "\ub370\ub4dc \uc624\ube0c \uc708\ud130: \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4\ub85c\ub4dc \uac8c\uc784"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__thumb/img/foFGN8KwmN8BaYNpolq0HcMba4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3016500.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__original/img/pOYQOSR1CnXcN6pEPx3yFDjKFaA=/0x0/pic3016500.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Creatures: Zombies", "Series: Crossroads (Plaid Hat Games)", "Theme: Post-Apocalyptic"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Horror", "Zombies"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Narrative Choice / Paragraph", "Push Your Luck", "Semi-Cooperative Game", "Storytelling", "Trading", "Traitor Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "designers": ["Jonathan Gilmour", "Isaac Vega"], "artists": ["David Richards", "Fernanda Su\u00e1rez", "Peter Wocken"], "publishers": ["Plaid Hat Games", "Arclight", "Asmodee Italia", "Cube Factory of Ideas", "Edge Entertainment", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Game Harbor", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Gemenot", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "MINDOK", "Raven Distribution", "Siam Board Games"], "description": "\"Crossroads\" is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.\n\nDead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!\n\nDead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.\n\nDead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "181307", "name": "Dead of Winter: Andrea Smith"}, {"id": "218041", "name": "Dead of Winter: BGG Crossroads Promo"}, {"id": "180704", "name": "Dead of Winter: Dice Tower Crossroads Promo"}, {"id": "174152", "name": "Dead of Winter: Felicia Day"}, {"id": "280071", "name": "Dead of Winter: Giggles"}, {"id": "231562", "name": "Dead of Winter: KD James"}, {"id": "150482", "name": "Dead of Winter: Kodiak Colby"}, {"id": "171217", "name": "Dead of Winter: Lucky Luke Smith"}, {"id": "231563", "name": "Dead of Winter: Meryl Wolfe"}, {"id": "195656", "name": "Dead of Winter: Rich Sommer"}, {"id": "183785", "name": "Dead of Winter: Roberta Plum"}, {"id": "203824", "name": "Dead of Winter: Rodney Smith"}, {"id": "234258", "name": "Dead of Winter: Ruckus Burley"}, {"id": "206094", "name": "Dead of Winter: Warring Colonies"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 38573, "average": 7.58468, "bayesaverage": 7.43729, "stddev": 1.42628, "median": 0.0, "owned": 52205, "trading": 1169, "wanting": 823, "wishing": 8483, "numcomments": 5509, "numweights": 1432, "averageweight": 3.0147, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 116}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 41}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 574, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 336}, "2": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 124, "not_recommended_rating": 266}, "3": {"best_rating": 65, "recommended_rating": 368, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "4": {"best_rating": 392, "recommended_rating": 128, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "5": {"best_rating": 174, "recommended_rating": 220, "not_recommended_rating": 60}, "5+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 246}}}, "usersrated": 38573.0, "average": 7.58468, "bayesaverage": 7.43729, "stddev": 1.42628, "median": 0.0, "owned": 52205.0, "trading": 1169.0, "wanting": 823.0, "wishing": 8483.0, "numcomments": 5509.0, "numweights": 1432.0, "averageweight": 3.0147, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 116}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 41}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "39856", "name": "Dixit", "alternative_names": ["Dixit \u062f\u064a\u0643\u0633\u062a", "\u0414\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0442", "\u30c7\u30a3\u30af\u30b7\u30c3\u30c8", "\u5999\u4e0d\u53ef\u8a00", "\u5999\u8a9e\u8aaa\u66f8\u4eba", "\u8a00\u4e0d\u9054\u610f", "\u96bb\u5b57\u7247\u8a9e", "\u96bb\u8a00\u7247\u8a9e", "\ub515\uc2ef"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uSgzS-SClISqDkYRCdUq6g__thumb/img/iLgQV17c4xezI4ZeN_hmue_jh40=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3483909.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uSgzS-SClISqDkYRCdUq6g__original/img/m74nctbYaqTy03r8s_i_KTyvbYQ=/0x0/pic3483909.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Meeples (Animal) / Animeeples", "Game: Dixit", "Mechanism: Give a Clue / Get a Clue", "Mechanism: Image Interpretation", "Mechanism: Judging Games"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Party Game"], "implementations": ["Dixit Demo Deck", "Dixit: Print & Play"], "mechanics": ["Communication Limits", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Storytelling", "Targeted Clues", "Voting"], "designers": ["Jean-Louis Roubira"], "artists": ["Marie Cardouat"], "publishers": ["Libellud", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Boardgame Space", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "hobbity.eu", "Hobby Japan", "KADABRA", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Morapiaf", "Nordic Games GmbH", "Paladium Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "2010 Spiel des Jahres Winner\n\nOne player is the storyteller for the turn and looks at the images on the 6 cards in her hand.

narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.\n\nIn Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...\n\nIn more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:\n\n\n    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.\n    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.\n    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.\n    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.\n    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.\n\n\nWhen a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who's reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "204573", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016"}, {"id": "234191", "name": "Camel Up: The Referee Camel & Istanbul \u2013 Caravan Leader Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "207573", "name": "Istanbul: Caravan Leader Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "161224", "name": "Istanbul: Kebab Shop Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "192779", "name": "Istanbul: Letters & Seals"}, {"id": "172505", "name": "Istanbul: Mocha & Baksheesh"}, {"id": "213217", "name": "Istanbul: Pegasus Depot Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "293240", "name": "Super Power"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 40, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 24573, "average": 7.58222, "bayesaverage": 7.4331, "stddev": 1.14172, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29597, "trading": 399, "wanting": 899, "wishing": 4956, "numcomments": 3644, "numweights": 928, "averageweight": 2.5894, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 117}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 98}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 307, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 166}, "2": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 167, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "3": {"best_rating": 96, "recommended_rating": 146, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 185, "recommended_rating": 62, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 45, "recommended_rating": 142, "not_recommended_rating": 31}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 120}}}, "usersrated": 24573.0, "average": 7.58222, "bayesaverage": 7.4331, "stddev": 1.14172, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29597.0, "trading": 399.0, "wanting": 899.0, "wishing": 4956.0, "numcomments": 3644.0, "numweights": 928.0, "averageweight": 2.5894, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 117}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 98}], "game_family": "Istanbul (AEG)", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "245654", "name": "Railroad Ink: Deep Blue Edition", "alternative_names": ["Kolejowy szlak: G\u0142\u0119boki b\u0142\u0119kit", "Railroad Ink: Diepblauwe versie", "Railroad Ink: Edi\u00e7\u00e3o Azul Profundo", "Railroad Ink: Edici\u00f3n azul profundo", "Railroad ink: Edition grand bleu", "Railroad Ink: Edition Tiefblau", "Le Strade d'Inchiostro: Edizione Blu Profondo", "Vas\u00fatvonal: S\u00f6t\u00e9tk\u00e9k Kiad\u00e1s", "\u0414\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438: \u0422\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e-\u0441\u0438\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f", "\u30ec\u30a4\u30eb\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30af:\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30fb\u30a8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\ub808\uc77c\ub85c\ub4dc \uc789\ud06c: \ub525 \ube14\ub8e8 \uc5d0\ub514\uc158"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3hjEgkxZE9M96o6wgj6Tw__thumb/img/idn6fyLMcqvmxqKXU57rAuLgMvg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4097632.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3hjEgkxZE9M96o6wgj6Tw__original/img/U7ET153g0zcfkbbRUsIZ4_Abqsc=/0x0/pic4097632.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Dice with Icons", "Components: Dry Erase Markers / Dry Erase Surfaces", "Game: Railroad Ink", "Mechanism: Roll-and-write", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Dice", "Trains"], "implementations": ["Railroad Ink Challenge: Lush Green Edition", "Railroad Ink Challenge: Shining Yellow Edition"], "mechanics": ["Bingo", "Connections", "Dice Rolling", "Line Drawing", "Network and Route Building", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Solo / Solitaire Game"], "designers": ["Hjalmar Hach", "Lorenzo Silva"], "artists": ["Marta Tranquilli"], "publishers": ["Horrible Guild", "Angry Lion Games", "CMON Limited", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Divercentro", "Edge Entertainment", "FoxGames", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Ghenos Games", "Hobby Japan", "InterHit", "White Goblin Games"], "description": "In the multiplayer puzzle game Railroad Ink, your goal is to connect as many exits on your board as possible. Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.\n\nThe more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?\n\nRailroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add new special rules to your games. The Deep Blue Edition includes the Rivers and Lakes expansions. Increase the difficulty by adding the River route into the mix, or use the Lakes to connect your networks by ferry. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different. Each box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more). The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "320731", "name": "Railroad Ink: Arcade Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320730", "name": "Railroad Ink: Eldritch Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320737", "name": "Railroad Ink: Electricity Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320734", "name": "Railroad Ink: Engineer Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320735", "name": "Railroad Ink: Future Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "263963", "name": "Railroad Ink: Promo Board #1 \u2013 Blue Train"}, {"id": "263964", "name": "Railroad Ink: Promo Board #2 \u2013 Red Train"}, {"id": "320736", "name": "Railroad Ink: Sky Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320732", "name": "Railroad Ink: Underground Expansion Pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 6041, "average": 7.28625, "bayesaverage": 6.89872, "stddev": 1.15459, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10221, "trading": 108, "wanting": 332, "wishing": 2081, "numcomments": 860, "numweights": 100, "averageweight": 1.55, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 480}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 98}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 74, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "2": {"best_rating": 41, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 25, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 19, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "6": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "6+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 25}}}, "usersrated": 6041.0, "average": 7.28625, "bayesaverage": 6.89872, "stddev": 1.15459, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10221.0, "trading": 108.0, "wanting": 332.0, "wishing": 2081.0, "numcomments": 860.0, "numweights": 100.0, "averageweight": 1.55, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 480}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 98}], "game_family": "Railroad Ink", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "245655", "name": "The King's Dilemma", "alternative_names": ["El Dilema del Rey", "Le Dilemme du Roi", "Dylematy Kr\u00f3la", "\u0414\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044f"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FJlTdSMkK5hMNtCympJFmg__thumb/img/WqPUfQOfiIe5FnBXz-EAavw5jCs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5429837.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FJlTdSMkK5hMNtCympJFmg__original/img/GsipoxqbuzY89vTkiW7I3C9cJv4=/0x0/pic5429837.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Mechanism: Legacy"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Negotiation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Bias", "Legacy Game", "Traitor Game", "Voting"], "designers": ["Hjalmar Hach", "Lorenzo Silva"], "artists": ["Giorgio Baroni", "Giulia Ghigini"], "publishers": ["Horrible Guild", "999 Games", "Asmodee", "CrowD Games", "Galakta", "Ghenos Games", "HeidelB\u00c4R Games", "IELLO"], "description": "The King's Dilemma is an interactive narrative experience with legacy elements, featuring several branching storylines leading to many possible finales and an evolving deck of event cards at its core.

Educated clerics fervently believe that angels guard the pious, and demons scourge the wicked, while the simpler folk watch the night for signs of werewolves and dragons. The game assumes that all of these are real.\n\nJoan of Arc is a story-driven board game that uses finely-sculpted miniatures and 3D scenery to set the scene for a game of cunning and skill (and a little luck). The game is a combination of interwoven card play, resource management, and position on the board. You will need to master all three to beat the best opponents. Getting your men into the right position, and heading off your enemy, will be no use if you cannot muster the cards and other resources to make the most of it. Joan of Arc allows a huge amount of freedom in your actions. In every turn, you can choose to spend or save resources, and when you come to activate a unit you can choose between combat, interrogation, search, exploration, prayers, and other actions. So, this turn, should you level up a hero, or spend that resource to buy a re-roll? Take extra actions now, or save them for later? Double-move that cavalry, or question the old woman in the woods? When and how to act are decisions you must make based on your objectives, and the situation on the board. And, what is the best decision one turn may be very different in the next.\n\nPlayers take the role of the various factions in the war, or of some of the supernatural creatures that have emerged from the shadows. The most famous heroes and heroines of the war are all here: the Black Prince, the Dauphin, Falstaff, and, of course, Joan of Arc herself. Each game is a unique scenario with its own map assembled from the gaming tiles, and a specified set of heroes and followers to achieve the scenario\u2019s objectives. Each scenario has its own victory conditions, often different for each side. In one game you may be an inquisitor, seeking out a werewolf hidden among the peasantry; in another you may be a victorious raiding party, desperately fighting your way through an ambush so you can return to the safety of your castle.\n\nScenarios range from small affairs with a few models and simplified role-play elements, to full battles with dozens of knights, archers and men-at-arms. All scenarios typically play in under an hour. The game also includes a battle mode, to fight out conflicts between armies of your choosing.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "257163", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Reliquary Box"}, {"id": "239722", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Apocalypse"}, {"id": "241009", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Ars Nova"}, {"id": "256459", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Compendium"}, {"id": "254628", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Legendary Battles"}, {"id": "254089", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Legendary Dragon"}, {"id": "257175", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Ottoman Army"}, {"id": "290351", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Sam the Blacksmith Promo Card"}, {"id": "256462", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Siege"}, {"id": "264378", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Super Exclusives"}, {"id": "291003", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Teutonic Knights"}, {"id": "264371", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 The Battle of Cravant"}, {"id": "244940", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Unleash Hell"}, {"id": "240082", "name": "Time of Legends: Joan of Arc \u2013 Village Pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 962, "average": 8.26526, "bayesaverage": 6.22075, "stddev": 1.90822, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2363, "trading": 64, "wanting": 115, "wishing": 794, "numcomments": 348, "numweights": 54, "averageweight": 3.4815, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1622}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 296}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 278}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 25, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "2": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 19, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 13}}}, "usersrated": 962.0, "average": 8.26526, "bayesaverage": 6.22075, "stddev": 1.90822, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2363.0, "trading": 64.0, "wanting": 115.0, "wishing": 794.0, "numcomments": 348.0, "numweights": 54.0, "averageweight": 3.4815, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1622}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 296}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 278}], "game_family": "Time of Legends \u2013 Joan of Arc", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "230802", "name": "Azul", "alternative_names": ["\u30a2\u30ba\u30fc\u30eb", "\u82b1\u78da\u7269\u8a9e", "\uc544\uc904"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tz19PfklMdAdjxV9WArraA__thumb/img/debo694HgBaIBeNGyxu1ELUbQGA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3718275.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tz19PfklMdAdjxV9WArraA__original/img/9-SR48jyfxs4At6255sjHoly2sw=/0x0/pic3718275.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Portugal", "Game: Azul", "Misc: Mensa Select", "Theme: Art"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Renaissance"], "implementations": ["Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra", "Azul: Summer Pavilion"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Drafting", "End Game Bonuses", "Pattern Building", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement", "Turn Order: Claim Action"], "designers": ["Michael Kiesling"], "artists": ["Philippe Gu\u00e9rin", "Chris Quilliams"], "publishers": ["Next Move Games", "Plan B Games", "Asmodee", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Divercentro", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Ghenos Games", "Hobby Japan", "KADABRA", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lacerta", "MINDOK", "Orangutan Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "Tower Tactic Games", "TWOPLUS Games", "Zvezda"], "description": "Introduced by the Moors, azulejos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles.

Search for the right pieces to complete torn parchments, broken pots, and other priceless artifacts. Explore an ancient pyramid in the hope of uncovering a huge stash of treasure! Trade shrewdly at the local marketplace to increase the value of your collection. Sell your treasures to the museum at just the right time for maximum profit.\n\nBut beware, the desert also has its dangers! A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!\n\nIn Archaeology: The New Expedition, you want to find treasures and make the most money possible by selling them to the museum. Players start with four treasure cards in hand; one monument tile is chosen at random, then the chambers of the monument are loaded secretly with treasure cards.\n\nOn a turn, a player digs for treasure by drawing from the deck. If they find treasure, they don't show anyone and keep it; if they find a thief, they steal a card at random from an opponent; and if they find a sandstorm, all players lose half of their cards in hand to the marketplace, which starts the game with five face-up cards. (Each player has a tent that they can discard to avoid the effects of one sandstorm.) After digging, a player can:\n\n\n     Discard one or more maps to explore one chamber of the monument, looking at all the cards there and keeping some number of them.\n\n\n\n     Trade at the marketplace by laying down one or more treasure cards and picking up cards with equal or lesser trading value.\n\n\n\n     Sell to the museum by placing sets of treasure cards in front of them; in general, the more cards you have of a type, the more the set is worth.\n\n\nPlayers can explore only once, but they can do the other actions repeatedly, and they can take these actions in any order. Once the deck is empty, players keep taking actions until they all pass in turn, after which they sell treasures to the museum. Whoever ends up with the most money wins!\n\nAccording to the designer, Archaeology: The New Expedition differs from Archaeology: The Card Game through the inclusion of tent cards, the addition of new treasure types and additional cards to allow for five players, the adjustment of some treasure values, and the inclusion of six monuments instead of one to have more variety when exploring.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 2676, "average": 7.15825, "bayesaverage": 6.53693, "stddev": 1.14752, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4356, "trading": 91, "wanting": 259, "wishing": 1309, "numcomments": 610, "numweights": 64, "averageweight": 1.2969, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 951}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 220}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 55, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "2": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "3": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 19, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 16}}}, "usersrated": 2676.0, "average": 7.15825, "bayesaverage": 6.53693, "stddev": 1.14752, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4356.0, "trading": 91.0, "wanting": 259.0, "wishing": 1309.0, "numcomments": 610.0, "numweights": 64.0, "averageweight": 1.2969, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 951}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 220}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "157969", "name": "Sheriff of Nottingham", "alternative_names": ["Nottingham b\u00edr\u00e1ja", "\u0160erif z Nottinghamu", "\u0160erif z Nottinghamu", "Seriful din Nottingham", "Le Sheriff de Notthingam", "El Sheriff de Nottingham", "Szeryf z Nottingham", "\u039f \u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c6\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039d\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03c7\u03b1\u03bc", "\u0428\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0444 \u041d\u043e\u0442\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043c\u0430", "\u0428\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0444\u044a\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0430\u043c", "\u0e1c\u0e39\u0e49\u0e15\u0e23\u0e27\u0e08\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e15\u0e17\u0e34\u0e07\u0e41\u0e2e\u0e21", "\u8afe\u4e01\u6f22\u8b66\u9577"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BBgLFKUzr6tcKtlIM2JSFw__thumb/img/JD5L_XrtkaKINUj8ILZqFMGcTsE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2075830.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BBgLFKUzr6tcKtlIM2JSFw__original/img/LhRnbdwJ77VnRI_yQg2ZFiwEq1E=/0x0/pic2075830.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: Nottingham (England)", "Country: England", "Folk Tales & Fairy Tales: Robin Hood", "Game: Sheriff of Nottingham", "Series: Dice Tower Essentials"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Humor", "Medieval", "Negotiation", "Novel-based", "Party Game"], "implementations": ["Sheriff of Nottingham (2nd Edition)", "Contraband", "Hart an der Grenze", "Robin Hood"], "mechanics": ["Betting and Bluffing", "Bribery", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Negotiation", "Role Playing", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["S\u00e9rgio Halaban", "Andr\u00e9 Zatz"], "artists": ["John Guytan", "Lorraine Schleter", "David Sladek"], "publishers": ["Arcane Wonders", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Cool Mini Or Not", "Edge Entertainment", "Fantasmagoria", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "IELLO", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Lavka Games", "Lex Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Reflexshop", "Siam Board Games"], "description": "Prince John is coming to Nottingham!

They agree to map out the labyrinth in its entirety first, then find each individual\u2019s favorite store, and then locate the exit. In order to evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then dash to the exit. That's the plan anyway\u2026but can they pull it off?\n\nMagic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator\u2026 All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together.\n\nAt the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "231506", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017"}, {"id": "238664", "name": "Magic Maze: 9 new tiles"}, {"id": "234154", "name": "Magic Maze: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017 Promo"}, {"id": "260658", "name": "Magic Maze: Hidden Roles"}, {"id": "230359", "name": "Magic Maze: Maximum Security"}, {"id": "308036", "name": "Magic Maze: Technische Anlagen"}, {"id": "293240", "name": "Super Power"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 15, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 15, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 14999, "average": 7.06541, "bayesaverage": 6.8944, "stddev": 1.32031, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22864, "trading": 396, "wanting": 378, "wishing": 3408, "numcomments": 2170, "numweights": 244, "averageweight": 1.7336, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 484}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 117}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 262, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 127}, "2": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 99, "not_recommended_rating": 67}, "3": {"best_rating": 42, "recommended_rating": 133, "not_recommended_rating": 17}, "4": {"best_rating": 191, "recommended_rating": 31, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 45, "recommended_rating": 102, "not_recommended_rating": 31}, "6": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 49}, "7": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 90}, "8": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 45, "not_recommended_rating": 99}, "8+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 117}}}, "usersrated": 14999.0, "average": 7.06541, "bayesaverage": 6.8944, "stddev": 1.32031, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22864.0, "trading": 396.0, "wanting": 378.0, "wishing": 3408.0, "numcomments": 2170.0, "numweights": 244.0, "averageweight": 1.7336, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 484}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 117}], "game_family": "Magic Maze", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "266121", "name": "Unlock!: Heroic Adventures", "alternative_names": ["Unlock!: Heldhaftige Avonturen"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/biw1DYvUdQ4-ZgIOtUDqhQ__thumb/img/Nv2EPGFRbeOzcJ2ErbN6EsET5CU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4432319.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/biw1DYvUdQ4-ZgIOtUDqhQ__original/img/1n12dU02uPreZXuErdE6qM8fvKU=/0x0/pic4432319.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Books: Alice in Wonderland", "Books: Sherlock Holmes", "Category: Escape Room Games", "Components: Digital Hybrid - App Required", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Unlock!"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Exploration", "Puzzle", "Real-time"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Storytelling"], "designers": ["Thomas Cau\u00ebt", "Cyril Demaegd", "Mathieu Casnin", "Dave Neale", "Vincent Goyat"], "artists": ["Arnaud Demaegd", "Laurent Bazart", "Mahulda Jelly"], "publishers": ["Space Cowboys", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press"], "description": "Unlock!

Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.\n\nIn the wake of the Canal\u2019s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard\u2014designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.\n\nIn Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col\u00f3n Free Trade Zone. Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends. At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.\n\nPanamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system\u2014\u201cpushing\u201d  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play.\n\nOn their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round. Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies. Each Company has a limited amount of Stock that the players can purchase in exchange for investing\u2014receiving a dividend each round. The questions for the players will be which companies are likely to yield higher dividends?\n\nThere\u2019s more to explore and several ways to win, but we ask that you join us at the table and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Panama Canal with a session of Panamax!\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 100, "minplaytime": 100, "maxplaytime": 100, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 3540, "average": 7.33237, "bayesaverage": 6.78426, "stddev": 1.315, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4973, "trading": 183, "wanting": 364, "wishing": 1318, "numcomments": 816, "numweights": 227, "averageweight": 3.7665, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 596}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 323}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 79, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "3": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "4": {"best_rating": 67, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 23}}}, "usersrated": 3540.0, "average": 7.33237, "bayesaverage": 6.78426, "stddev": 1.315, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4973.0, "trading": 183.0, "wanting": 364.0, "wishing": 1318.0, "numcomments": 816.0, "numweights": 227.0, "averageweight": 3.7665, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 596}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 323}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "131357", "name": "Coup", "alternative_names": ["Coup \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u062a\u0627", "Coup. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442", "Coup: City State", "Coup: Ciudad Corrupta", "Coup: No\u010dn\u00ed klub", "Coup: The Resistance Universe", "Coup: Urbis", "Entrika", "\u015awiatowy Konflikt", "\u03a4\u03bf \u039a\u03cc\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf", "\u03a4\u03bf \u039a\u03cc\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf: 2\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2", "\u05d4\u05e4\u05d9\u05db\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d9\u05e8-\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4", "\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e42\u0e04\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e33\u0e19\u0e32\u0e08", "\u30af\u30fc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MWhSY_GOe2-bmlQ2rntSVg__thumb/img/vuR_0PCX1w2EkjO_LbchOHZPOwU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2016054.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MWhSY_GOe2-bmlQ2rntSVg__original/img/4zmqrQ4v-rufRQM_oinFDQ6HykI=/0x0/pic2016054.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Series: Postcard Box Games (Indie Boards and Cards)", "Setting: Dystopian Universe (Indie Boards & Cards)"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction", "Party Game", "Political"], "implementations": ["Complots", "Coup Deluxe:  Mobile Edition", "Coup: Rebellion G54"], "mechanics": ["Hidden Roles", "Memory", "Player Elimination", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Rikki Tahta"], "artists": ["Luis Francisco", "Stephanie Gustafsson", "Andrew Higgins", "Alexandr Kiselev", "Prapach Lapamnuaysap", "Tomasz Larek", "Jarek Noco\u0144", "Guillermo H.

You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...\n\nIn Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.\n\nEach player starts the game with two coins and two influence \u2013 i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:\n\n\n     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.\n     Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.\n     Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.\n     Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.\n     Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.\n\n\nOn your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:\n\n\n     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.\n     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.\n     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)\n\n\nWhen you take one of the character actions \u2013 whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action \u2013 that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.\n\nIf you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.\n\nThe last player to still have influence \u2013 that is, a face-down character \u2013 wins the game!\n\nA new & optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards & Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.\n\n\n     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck. They then shuffle the old card into the Court deck.

Over five rounds, players program their decisions about price, production, research, and expansion in order to earn more profits and become the most successful company in the world by earning more money than rivals. The game features a unique mechanism of planning, which combines patching mechanisms with bidding and action selection. Each of the rounds consists of eight simple phases: planning, pricing, production, development, research, expansion, selling, and profits.\n\nIn the planning phase, all players simultaneously make a decision for the next year by patching their two plan cards and all of their development tiles. This plan determines all of the other phases, as players will use planned actions in them.\n\nDuring the pricing phase, players change their price, according their decision. A lower price helps to go earlier and sell more smartphones on the market, but higher price while risky help player to earn more money.\n\nIn production, all players simultaneously produce smartphones, based on their plan.\n\nIn development, players in turn order take the development tiles, which expands their plan possibilities in further rounds. All following phases will be played in turn order.\n\nIn research, players in turn order use their research points based on their decision to discover new technologies. Each technology has not only expanded players' ability to sell smartphones to the customers, but also give them special power. There are 6 different technologies in the game, with every one of them has two different powers to use.\n\nIn the expansion phase, players use expansion points from their plan to open offices in neighbor regions, which allow them to sell in that region and develop their network of offices to more regions in further turns.\n\nIn the sale phase, players sell produced phones in regions, where they have offices. But there is limited space in regions - if your price is to high, faster rivals can block you from selling. At the end of the phase all unsold smartphones are utilized.\n\nIn the profit phase, you get income for your smartphones. All sold phones get you as many dollars, as their price. Also the player who sold more phones in the region gets profits for controlling the accessory market. At the end of this phase all sold smartphones discarded from the map - and a new round begins.\n\nAfter five rounds, the richest player wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "306864", "name": "Smartphone Inc.: Status Update 1.1"}], "expands": [{"id": "326793", "name": "Smart Phone: Innovation Pack \u2013 DT"}], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 1642, "average": 7.76025, "bayesaverage": 6.66501, "stddev": 1.19475, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3214, "trading": 34, "wanting": 415, "wishing": 1584, "numcomments": 415, "numweights": 52, "averageweight": 2.7885, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 757}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 365}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 43, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "3": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 18, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "4": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 13}}}, "usersrated": 1642.0, "average": 7.76025, "bayesaverage": 6.66501, "stddev": 1.19475, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3214.0, "trading": 34.0, "wanting": 415.0, "wishing": 1584.0, "numcomments": 415.0, "numweights": 52.0, "averageweight": 2.7885, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 757}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 365}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "246784", "name": "Cryptid", "alternative_names": ["Cryptide", "\u041a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0434", "\u8a6d\u5f71\u5c0b\u8e64", "\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2f0\ub4dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qrPLpAnhFgc470ZRuXlvbg__thumb/img/ZFL0o-lhnuWE21Sa9YS8qi8ayGU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4037705.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qrPLpAnhFgc470ZRuXlvbg__original/img/DY93t1kU-zh12BW1ar2gQewvVqk=/0x0/pic4037705.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Creatures: Monsters"], "categories": ["Deduction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Deduction", "Hexagon Grid", "Modular Board", "Pattern Recognition"], "designers": ["Hal Duncan", "Ruth Veevers"], "artists": ["Kwanchai Moriya"], "publishers": ["Osprey Games", "17wanzy (Yihu BG)", "Do it games", "Fabrika Igr", "Origames", "Playagame Edizioni", "Skellig Games", "sternenschimmermeer"], "description": "You've studied the footage, connected the dots, and gathered what meager evidence you could.

A computer malfunction at the Bedlam Zoo has short-circuited the gates for all the enclosures and the animals are escaping and making their way to the zoo exit. You will work together with your fellow zookeepers to round up all the animals and lock their enclosures before it's too late.\n\nZoo Break is a crisis-management game that requires dynamic and cooperative problem-solving. You will spend your turn deciding how to use limited actions to move about the board, collect and trade supplies, capture animals, and lock cages, all while evading injury and coping with other challenges caused by the animals marauding through the zoo. Escape and Move cards control the animals with maximum variability, leading to endlessly different game scenarios.\n\nSuccess hinges on the keepers' ability to anticipate, adapt, and make strategic decisions, applying their skills and resources to regain control of the zoo. It's complex and suspenseful enough to keep adults riveted, but also playful and inviting to ambitious, game-loving kids.

As for the story, here's the set-up:\n\nPlayers take on the role of Sam, whose daughter has been in a coma for over two months and whose doctors still cannot explain how this happened or what caused it. According to them, everything is fine with the girl; she's healthy and shouldn't be in this condition. Sam is desperate and looks for answers everywhere he can, which leads to a weird meeting with Mark.\n\nMark's son was once in a similar situation, and his father was able to help wake the boy up. He has given Sam a scary-looking book and said that inside this book he will find a ritual called \"The Awakening\". But Mark warned Sam that he needs to prepare himself mentally since this ritual will transfer him into another dimension, where he should be able to find his daughter and understand what is the cause of this state. If Sam's lucky enough, then he will be able to wake her up as well. Sam has held onto the book for more than a week. Finally, he's ready to go into the basement and perform a ritual. Are you ready, too?\n\nContent warning: suicide\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 300, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 300, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 1657, "average": 7.25447, "bayesaverage": 6.4044, "stddev": 1.48776, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3562, "trading": 157, "wanting": 111, "wishing": 796, "numcomments": 351, "numweights": 27, "averageweight": 2.1111, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1172}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 225}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 32, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 18}}}, "usersrated": 1657.0, "average": 7.25447, "bayesaverage": 6.4044, "stddev": 1.48776, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3562.0, "trading": 157.0, "wanting": 111.0, "wishing": 796.0, "numcomments": 351.0, "numweights": 27.0, "averageweight": 2.1111, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1172}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 225}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "283077", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Dreadfane", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RIKpxaaACX8NHnMTeYTeow__thumb/img/z_v_jFxCHlFoH7Tey8yqDA13mHc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4814266.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RIKpxaaACX8NHnMTeYTeow__original/img/shKluev50gVnYk-uoUom9uOl9r0=/0x0/pic4814266.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Warhammer Underworlds"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement"], "designers": ["John Bracken", "Dave Sanders"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Games Workshop Ltd."], "description": "Mighty champions do battle in the cursed arenas of the Mirrored City.

You are the robots that are trying to build the colony before the settlers arrive. The goal in Magic Maze on Mars is to build \"domes\" where the settlers can live, then to guide them to their domes when they arrive. When time runs out, they are out of oxygen.\n\nTo begin, place the starting tile in the middle of the table. Deal out the appropriate action tiles and shuffle the four A tiles in a pile face down.\n\nCreating resources: A player with blue on their action tile can always create blue resources at the blue factory so long as a resource is not already there. The player simply takes a blue resource from the bank and places it on the resource station next to the factory. The resources of other colors are built on the factories of their color, with these factories becoming available when you build new tiles.\n\nMoving resources: Players can move resources along the roads with a color that they have on their action tile. A player might have an action tile that shows red and orange, so they can move resources along red and orange roads. You move resources from one \"station\" to another, but each station can hold only one resource, and resources cannot move through a station that holds another resource.\n\nNote: When moving resources, you must physically move the resource all the way, so the other players can see what is happening. Even if there is a long stretch of road that you are able to move on, you cannot move the resource directly.\n\nBuilding new tiles: To do this, you need to have a resource of the station's color on the station, e.g., a blue resource on a blue station. Once the resource is there, a player with this color on their action tile can remove the resource and place the top tile face up at the position. Place the tile with the small arrow pointing from where it was build.\n\nWatching the time: As in Magic Maze, players have a time limit in Magic Maze on Mars. To flip the sand timer, you must move any resource onto a timer space. Return the resource to the bank and place a timer token on the timer space to show that it cannot be used again. By doing this, you send a signal to the settlers that the colony is not ready yet; they will then orbit Mars once more before landing, but they can't do this indefinitely.\n\nBuilding domes: Some tiles have spaces available for domes. In order to build a dome, you need to place the depicted resources on the dome spot, e.g., green, yellow, and red. When all the necessary resources are placed on the dome, any player can put all the resources back in the bank and place a dome (taken from the communication board).\n\nWhen you have built all the domes, the settlers arrive. Place all the settlers on the rocket. Then move the settlers just like you move resources. You have won as soon as one settler inhabits each dome. There cannot be more than one settler on each station, and they cannot walk through resources. Once the settlers arrive, you can no longer flip the sand timer! (It does not help to send them messages about orbiting Mars since they are already here.) If time runs out, you have lost.\n\n\u2014description from publisher\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 15, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 15, "minage": 7, "stats": {"usersrated": 227, "average": 7.0452, "bayesaverage": 5.69652, "stddev": 1.39877, "median": 0.0, "owned": 420, "trading": 8, "wanting": 54, "wishing": 320, "numcomments": 58, "numweights": 5, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4806}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 5, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 3}}}, "usersrated": 227.0, "average": 7.0452, "bayesaverage": 5.69652, "stddev": 1.39877, "median": 0.0, "owned": 420.0, "trading": 8.0, "wanting": 54.0, "wishing": 320.0, "numcomments": 58.0, "numweights": 5.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4806}], "game_family": "Magic Maze", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "283393", "name": "Aquatica", "alternative_names": ["Atlantes", "\uc544\ucfe0\uc544\ud2f0\uce74"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_8WvjlAU1_Y0qhwTjXvbnA__thumb/img/8zjeyk9juPqsHIwuPt7wiZFia-M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5578646.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_8WvjlAU1_Y0qhwTjXvbnA__original/img/H4jgn1gz3IY4YvCdbvxOOlhGMLY=/0x0/pic5578646.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Theme: Under the Sea"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Nautical"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Retrieval", "Card Drafting", "Drafting", "Hand Management", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Slide/Push", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Ivan Tuzovsky"], "artists": ["Irina Kuzmina", "Andrew Modestov", "Oleg Proshin", "Artur Varenyev", "Marat Zakirov"], "publishers": ["Cosmodrome Games", "Arcane Wonders", "BoardM Factory", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Cranio Creations", "Gigamic", "Portal Games"], "description": "Aquatica  is a deep, but easy to learn family engine builder about underwater kingdoms.\n\nIn the game you will become one of the mighty ocean kings, struggling to bring glory to his realm.

Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.\n Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?\n\nOf course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.\n\nGalaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.\n\nBuilding happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.\n\nOnce building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.\n\nMost of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!\n\n3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components.

Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock.  This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more.\n\nIn Cosmic Encounter, each player is the leader of an alien race. On a player's turn, he or she becomes the offense.  The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet.  The offense draws from the destiny deck which contains colors, wilds and specials.  He or she then takes the hyperspace gate and points at one planet in the system indicated by the drawn destiny card.  The offense vs. the defenses ships are in the encounter and both sides are able to invite allies, play an encounter card as well as special cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.\n\nThe object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems, just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems.

The polar bear (ursus maritimus) weighs \"only\" 1,100 lbs., but gets much bigger than the Kodiak bear, being as much as 11 ft. tall!\n\nB\u00e4renpark takes you into the world of bears, challenging you to build your own bear park. Would you like another polar bear enclosure or rather a koala* house? The park visitors are sure to get hungry on their tour through the park, so build them places to eat! Whatever your choices are, make sure you get the next building permit and use your land wisely! (* No, koalas aren't bears but they're so cute, we couldn't leave them out of this game!)\n\nIn more detail, each player in B\u00e4renpark builds their own bear park, attempting to make it as beautiful as they can, while also using every square meter possible. The park is created by combining polyomino tiles onto a grid, with players scoring for animal houses, outdoor areas, completed construction, and more. The sooner you build it, the better! Cover icons to get new tiles and park sections. The game ends as soon as one player has finished expanding their park, then players tally their points to see who has won.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "264238", "name": "B\u00e4renpark: The Bad News Bears"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 11367, "average": 7.3614, "bayesaverage": 7.11924, "stddev": 1.06728, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15500, "trading": 167, "wanting": 850, "wishing": 3460, "numcomments": 1772, "numweights": 235, "averageweight": 1.6553, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 286}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 43}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 126, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 78}, "2": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 86, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "3": {"best_rating": 42, "recommended_rating": 66, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 66, "recommended_rating": 41, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 62}}}, "usersrated": 11367.0, "average": 7.3614, "bayesaverage": 7.11924, "stddev": 1.06728, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15500.0, "trading": 167.0, "wanting": 850.0, "wishing": 3460.0, "numcomments": 1772.0, "numweights": 235.0, "averageweight": 1.6553, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 286}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 43}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "155821", "name": "Inis", "alternative_names": ["\u0418\u043d\u0438\u0448", "\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e5", "\u7fe0\u5dbc\u79d8\u5883 Inis"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QE8mnPFmauoj2THsyUYPA__thumb/img/m63hnvHi6jqlva52FGaWbEqzjys=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4739757.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QE8mnPFmauoj2THsyUYPA__original/img/kVKdykQUGNsAj0nnvpWxO7N3ePI=/0x0/pic4739757.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Components: Multi-Use Cards", "Country: Ireland", "Mythology: Celtic"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Miniatures", "Mythology"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Map Addition", "Modular Board", "Variable Phase Order"], "designers": ["Christian Martinez"], "artists": ["Dimitri Bielak", "Jim Fitzpatrick"], "publishers": ["Matagot", "Gen-X Games", "Hobby Japan", "Lavka Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "Portal Games", "Surfin' Meeple", "Surfin' Meeple China"], "description": "Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis). Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:\n\n\n     Leadership: Be the leader \u2014 i.e., have more clan figures than any other player \u2014 of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.\n     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.\n     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.\n\n\nOver the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.\n\nAt the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect \"epic tales\" cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.\n\nCareful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.\n\nWhile Inis has \"dudes\" that are \"on a map\", it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "255588", "name": "Inis: Seasons of Inis"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 12097, "average": 7.79516, "bayesaverage": 7.47064, "stddev": 1.481, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15573, "trading": 196, "wanting": 1261, "wishing": 6621, "numcomments": 2071, "numweights": 323, "averageweight": 2.8854, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 108}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 87}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 275, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 165}, "2": {"best_rating": 58, "recommended_rating": 120, "not_recommended_rating": 43}, "3": {"best_rating": 91, "recommended_rating": 145, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4": {"best_rating": 154, "recommended_rating": 75, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 111}}}, "usersrated": 12097.0, "average": 7.79516, "bayesaverage": 7.47064, "stddev": 1.481, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15573.0, "trading": 196.0, "wanting": 1261.0, "wishing": 6621.0, "numcomments": 2071.0, "numweights": 323.0, "averageweight": 2.8854, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 108}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 87}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "181279", "name": "Fury of Dracula (Third/Fourth Edition)", "alternative_names": ["B\u011bsn\u011bn\u00ed Dr\u00e1kuly", "Dracula", "La Fureur de Dracula", "La Furia de Dr\u00e1cula", "La Furia di Dracula", "Fury of Dracula", "\u042f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044b", "\u30c9\u30e9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e9\u306e\u9006\u8972", "\u5fb7\u53e4\u62c9\u4e4b\u6012"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iLiUp891Wqb5EE0gBqjBaA__thumb/img/Jg01alIAt8H1KI6gFhS-naLJans=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4411188.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iLiUp891Wqb5EE0gBqjBaA__original/img/jG9uFHo4Ckhocm6NuyBSTiQwgJs=/0x0/pic4411188.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Books: Dracula", "Components: Miniatures", "Continents: Europe", "Creatures: Vampires", "Game: Fury of Dracula", "Mechanism: Hidden Movement", "Players: One versus Many"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Deduction", "Fighting", "Horror", "Novel-based"], "implementations": ["Fury of Dracula (Second Edition)"], "mechanics": ["Hidden Movement", "Point to Point Movement", "Resource to Move", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Frank Brooks", "Stephen Hand", "Kevin Wilson"], "artists": ["Chris Beck", "Samuel Shimota"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Arclight", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Game Harbor", "Games Workshop Ltd.", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "WizKids"], "description": "The third edition of Fury of Dracula features all-new art and graphic design crafted to complement the game's intuitive, thematic mechanisms.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s\u00e9ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.\n\nUnable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.\n\nIn Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.\n\nEach hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.\n\nAfter time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.\n\nIf one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.\n\nMediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards \u2014 one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon \u2014 then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.\n\nIf a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "204573", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016"}, {"id": "231506", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017"}, {"id": "259717", "name": "Mysterium: Blue Jay"}, {"id": "213223", "name": "Mysterium: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016 Promo"}, {"id": "234156", "name": "Mysterium: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017 Promo"}, {"id": "214735", "name": "Mysterium: Game Day 2016 Promo Card"}, {"id": "192661", "name": "Mysterium: Hidden Signs"}, {"id": "282537", "name": "Mysterium: Potions"}, {"id": "186293", "name": "Mysterium: Promo Cards"}, {"id": "216465", "name": "Mysterium: Secrets & Lies"}, {"id": "202669", "name": "Mysterium: The Meeple"}, {"id": "179656", "name": "Tajemnicze Domostwo: Motive cards"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 42, "minplaytime": 42, "maxplaytime": 42, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 30900, "average": 7.31523, "bayesaverage": 7.17911, "stddev": 1.37512, "median": 0.0, "owned": 46798, "trading": 687, "wanting": 680, "wishing": 6405, "numcomments": 4391, "numweights": 689, "averageweight": 1.9057, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 243}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 87}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 46}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 324, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 229}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 197}, "3": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 127, "not_recommended_rating": 108}, "4": {"best_rating": 71, "recommended_rating": 190, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "5": {"best_rating": 202, "recommended_rating": 74, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6": {"best_rating": 153, "recommended_rating": 95, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "7": {"best_rating": 82, "recommended_rating": 116, "not_recommended_rating": 39}, "7+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 156}}}, "usersrated": 30900.0, "average": 7.31523, "bayesaverage": 7.17911, "stddev": 1.37512, "median": 0.0, "owned": 46798.0, "trading": 687.0, "wanting": 680.0, "wishing": 6405.0, "numcomments": 4391.0, "numweights": 689.0, "averageweight": 1.9057, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 243}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 87}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 46}], "game_family": "Mysterium", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 12, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "216600", "name": "Fantastic Factories", "alternative_names": ["\ud310\ud0c0\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AzNYQ2o-SXBAHFpPPtRBIw__thumb/img/CkfTNq419k6DTJthFwPA5oKYoHE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4095959.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AzNYQ2o-SXBAHFpPPtRBIw__original/img/abrAKCffN7rGIOBLwTsQI_zsA9g=/0x0/pic4095959.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Worker Placement with Dice Workers"], "designers": ["Joseph Z Chen", "Justin Faulkner"], "artists": ["Joseph Z Chen"], "publishers": ["Metafactory Games", "BoardM Factory", "Deep Water Games", "Strohmann Games"], "description": "It's a manufacturing arms race! Compete against other players as you try to build the most efficient set of factories in the shortest time. You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!\n\nIn Fantastic Factories, you race to manufacture the most goods or build the most prestigious buildings. There are elements of dice rolling, worker placement, engine building, resource management, tableau building, simultaneous play, and some card drafting. Each round is split into two phases, the market phase and the work phase.\n\nDuring the market phase, you choose to either acquire a new blueprint for free or pay to hire a contractor. Blueprints are used to construct new factories during the work phase. Contractors can be used to reinforce your strategy by providing resources or allowing you to roll additional dice. You need to be mindful of what cards are available in the marketplace and the strategies your opponents may be pursuing.\n\nDuring the work phase, all players simultaneously roll their dice and use their dice as workers to run factories. Factories start as blueprints and need to be constructed. Once constructed, each factory can be used once each turn. Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct sequence can enable a powerful chain of actions. Additionally, you can build training facilities that allow you to manipulate the dice values of your workers. Each work phase is like solving a unique worker placement puzzle in order to optimize your output of resources and goods.\n\nOnce any player has manufactured 12 goods or constructed 10 buildings, the game end is triggered and one additional and final round is played. The player with the most points wins (combination of building prestige and manufactured goods). With over 30 unique blueprints and countless synergies across buildings, each game is unique. Fantastic Factories offers a lot of replay value and satisfaction as players discover new factory engines with each game.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\nA large collection of solo puzzles have also been created for Fantastic Factories along with official tools to create more.

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.\n\nThe objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.\n\nThe game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.\n\nThis procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.\n\nEach detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "245755", "name": "Watson & Holmes: La dama encarcelada"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 75, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 75, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 2168, "average": 7.36029, "bayesaverage": 6.57657, "stddev": 1.36545, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4758, "trading": 140, "wanting": 216, "wishing": 1281, "numcomments": 438, "numweights": 40, "averageweight": 2.225, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 883}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 170}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 31, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "6": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "7": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "7+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 10}}}, "usersrated": 2168.0, "average": 7.36029, "bayesaverage": 6.57657, "stddev": 1.36545, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4758.0, "trading": 140.0, "wanting": 216.0, "wishing": 1281.0, "numcomments": 438.0, "numweights": 40.0, "averageweight": 2.225, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 883}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 170}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "182704", "name": "SteamRollers", "alternative_names": ["SteamRollers: Maszyny parowe"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QIU_I-1iZqyc6YXN-r5FPg__thumb/img/Qaj_g5WXAjiq4of65qTeRx17VUA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4008984.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QIU_I-1iZqyc6YXN-r5FPg__original/img/REOlkdgr4JcF-QBZVQM9UZXmR4A=/0x0/pic4008984.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Dice with Icons", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Mechanism: Roll-and-write", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Dice", "Trains"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Network and Route Building", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Take That"], "designers": ["Mark Gerrits"], "artists": ["Benjamin Ben\u00e9teau"], "publishers": ["Flatlined Games", "2 Pionki", "Portal Games", "Stronghold Games"], "description": "In SteamRollers, players use dice to build the best railway network, upgrade their engine, and beat their opponents to the most lucrative cargo deliveries.

As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. Players need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times, and rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?\n\nThe aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing various buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's cathedral. Throughout the game, players need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhanded deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished.

During each mission, it is not the amount of tricks, but the right tricks at the right time that count.\n\nThe team completes a mission only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks.\n\nThe game comes with 50 missions, with three additional missions published in spielbox 2/2020.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "307204", "name": "The Crew: Flight to the ISS"}, {"id": "311184", "name": "The Crew: The Deimos Adventure"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 11141, "average": 8.02773, "bayesaverage": 7.69018, "stddev": 1.22559, "median": 0.0, "owned": 23668, "trading": 141, "wanting": 475, "wishing": 4109, "numcomments": 1679, "numweights": 256, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 50}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 43}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 3}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 242, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 141}, "2": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 81}, "3": {"best_rating": 49, "recommended_rating": 119, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "4": {"best_rating": 164, "recommended_rating": 36, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 88, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 107}}}, "usersrated": 11141.0, "average": 8.02773, "bayesaverage": 7.69018, "stddev": 1.22559, "median": 0.0, "owned": 23668.0, "trading": 141.0, "wanting": 475.0, "wishing": 4109.0, "numcomments": 1679.0, "numweights": 256.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 50}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 43}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 3}], "game_family": "The Crew", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "202426", "name": "Sidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition", "alternative_names": ["Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant", "Siderische Konfluenz: Handel und Wandel im Elysium-Sektor"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__thumb/img/ptUAPVk_LoqX7qDUt7ngtDXe-Qw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4981297.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__original/img/lSxD12d-Nm7OWYs8hU8iGgdIkQQ=/0x0/pic4981297.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Economic", "Negotiation", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Negotiation", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["TauCeti Deichmann"], "artists": ["Kwanchai Moriya", "Jesse Seidule", "Nakarin Sukontakorn"], "publishers": ["WizKids", "Frosted Games", "Pegasus Spiele"], "description": "Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant is a singularly unique trading and negotiation game for 4-9 players. Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.\n\nEach player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.\n\nEach game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.\n\nThe ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.\n\nThe game is almost all simultaneous play.\n\nSidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 4, "maxplayers": 9, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 2228, "average": 7.80451, "bayesaverage": 6.85096, "stddev": 1.65084, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3186, "trading": 94, "wanting": 500, "wishing": 2328, "numcomments": 637, "numweights": 85, "averageweight": 3.6706, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 523}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 260}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 55, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 33}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 23}, "4": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "5": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "6": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "7": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "8": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "9": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 24, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "9+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 25}}}, "usersrated": 2228.0, "average": 7.80451, "bayesaverage": 6.85096, "stddev": 1.65084, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3186.0, "trading": 94.0, "wanting": 500.0, "wishing": 2328.0, "numcomments": 637.0, "numweights": 85.0, "averageweight": 3.6706, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 523}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 260}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD & DT"}, {"id": "208024", "name": "The Reckoners", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pErtwXL-jxcz_l7akqACmg__thumb/img/ixsm739pmLZwGaqksGykCp-pkXI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3584095.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pErtwXL-jxcz_l7akqACmg__original/img/zjyFqiCSMPium81KSIWOzus08qo=/0x0/pic3584095.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Game Trayz Inside", "Components: Miniatures", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Madison Game Design Cabal"], "categories": ["Dice", "Novel-based", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Push Your Luck", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Brett Sobol", "Seth Van Orden"], "artists": ["Noah Adelman", "Miguel Coimbra", "Ian O'Toole"], "publishers": ["Nauvoo Games"], "description": "The Reckoners, a game based on the young adult fantasy novels by Brandon Sanderson, allows players to take on the roles of the novels' protagonists and work together to save the world.\n\nBackground:\n10 years ago... A mysterious burst in the sky gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. They're called Epics. But, every Epic turned out to be evil. Today, in the city once known as Chicago (now Newcago), an all-powerful Epic named Steelheart reigns supreme!\n\nNobody fights back... nobody but the Reckoners! This is where you come in. You are a member of the Reckoners, a skilled group of normal humans who assassinate Epics. Your mission is simple, but not easy. Take down Steelheart and his Epics and save the city.\n\nGameplay:\nThe Reckoners is a simultaneous, co-operative game for 1-6 players that plays in 75 minutes. You win by defeating Steelheart. But before you can defeat him, you must first discover his weakness. Throughout the game, you will work with your fellow Reckoners to research and attack Steelheart, but he is not alone. Numerous Epics are scattered throughout the city, and they will wreak havoc upon the population, if left unchecked. If the Epics manage to destroy Newcago by reducing the population to 0, then all Reckoners lose.\n\nThe Reckoners determine which actions to take primarily through a simultaneous, dice rolling mechanism, where each player can keep and reroll results up to three times at their own pace. Equipment Cards and Plan Tokens will also allow you to gain extra actions or improve/manipulate the results of your dice. Actions are resolved simultaneously as well, so communication and collaborative planning are key to ensuring optimal outcomes.\n\nYour dice can be used to attack Epics, research Epics, contain Epics, attack Enforcement, earn money, acquire Plan Tokens, move around the game board, remove barricades, and activate special equipment powers. Researching and Attacking Epics will help you earn valuable rewards, including clues about Steelheart's weakness. But, there will always be more Epics than you, so you have to choose your battles wisely. When all actions have been taken by The Reckoners, then it's the Epics turn.\n\nEach round, all of the Epics are going to activate, performing an array of actions and then powering up to be even more devastating next round. Each Epic also has a unique set of actions it performs, so you're always facing multiple threats that function very differently. The crux of the game is deciding how to resolve these competing threats and prioritize your actions together to eliminate Epics and ultimately win the game. How, when, and where you act will determine your victory or failure.\n\nSummary:\nIn short, The Reckoners plays like a challenging, ever-shifting puzzle. If you like co-operative games where you carefully manage resources, build powerful action combos, create tactical plans with your teammates, and work together to take down the bad guy while on the brink of defeat, then be sure to check out The Reckoners.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "256238", "name": "The Reckoners: Kickstarter Promo Pack"}, {"id": "319115", "name": "The Reckoners: Steelslayer"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 100, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 100, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 1336, "average": 7.82271, "bayesaverage": 6.52143, "stddev": 1.36732, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2429, "trading": 41, "wanting": 250, "wishing": 1142, "numcomments": 326, "numweights": 41, "averageweight": 2.7317, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 982}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 159}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 28, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "6": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 14}}}, "usersrated": 1336.0, "average": 7.82271, "bayesaverage": 6.52143, "stddev": 1.36732, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2429.0, "trading": 41.0, "wanting": 250.0, "wishing": 1142.0, "numcomments": 326.0, "numweights": 41.0, "averageweight": 2.7317, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 982}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 159}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "92415", "name": "Skull", "alternative_names": ["Gringo", "Skull & Roses", "Skull & Roses Black", "Skull & Roses Red", "Skull: Kopony\u00e1k j\u00e1t\u00e9ka", "\uc2a4\uceec"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4E9rSeKJDXiBbKmyMNtM7Q__thumb/img/zLo-17a1UkBwLj3bgr-cTy34Mlk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1779342.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4E9rSeKJDXiBbKmyMNtM7Q__original/img/3uBVJuvnZ5GUa-bEXP0PEcACPuw=/0x0/pic1779342.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Holidays: Day of the Dead"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Party Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Player Elimination"], "designers": ["Herv\u00e9 Marly"], "artists": ["Rose Kipik", "Thomas Vuarchex"], "publishers": ["Asmodee", "Asmodee Italia", "DiceTree Games", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Granna", "Lui-m\u00eame"], "description": "Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:\n\nSkull & Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads.

Banks of turbolasers unleash torrential volleys of fire against squadrons of X-wing and TIEs. Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields. Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield. Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.\n\nIn Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance. You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game\u2019s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it\u2019s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy.\n\nManeuver Tool\nThe maneuver tool is one of the game\u2019s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars.\n\nIt consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship's course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.\n\nCommand Stack\nArmada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy\u2019s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences.\n\nCapital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they\u2019re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can\u2019t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.\n\nEach of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice. Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "198787", "name": "Star Wars: Armada \u2013  Rebel Transports Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "169017", "name": "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Assault Frigate

Build your warband, construct your deck, and defeat your rivals.\n\nShadespire was once a city of wonder and magic, a mercantile metropolis whose rulers defied death, to the fury of Nagash. During the height of the city\u2019s powers, rivals, thieves and would-be conquerors were locked away in the sprawling dungeon known as the Nightvault. After the city\u2019s fall, Nagash broke open the chains that bound the shackled spirits within, giving them weapons to freeze the hearts of the living and enough memory of their torment to fill them with hatred and jealousy. The spectral dead delight in the chance to inflict this hatred upon the living, and the streets of Shadespire echo to the sounds of terrifying screams and cruel, mocking laughter...\n\nThe Game\n\nIn Warhammer Underworlds, you and your opponent pick a warband \u2013 2 are included in this box \u2013 and build a deck of power and objective cards. After placing your warband on the hex-tiled game boards, you take turns making actions \u2013 movement and attacks \u2013 until 3 phases are played. Between actions, you can use the power cards to introduce effects and reactions that can swing the battle in your favour; building the best deck you can and using cunning to deploy these abilities at the perfect time is the secret to mastering the game and dominating your foe. Merely vanquishing your opponent\u2019s warband does not guarantee victory \u2013 capturing objectives, standing your ground, making the best tactical choices and deploying the right cards at the right time will gain you the glory points you need to win!\n\nOnce you\u2019re familiar with the rules, games will take around 30 minutes \u2013 you\u2019ll always have time for a rematch.\n\nIn The Box\n\nEverything you and a friend need to play games of Warhammer Underworlds is included in this box. Contained within:\n\n\n     A Stormcast Eternals warband \u2013 Stormsire\u2019s Cursebreakers \u2013 made up of 3 push-fit, blue plastic miniatures (Rastus the Charmed, Ammis Dawnguard and the leader, Averon Stormsire);\n     A Nighthaunt warband \u2013 the Thorns of the Briarqueen \u2013 made up of 7 push-fit, bone-coloured plastic miniatures (The Ever-Hanged, Varclav the Cruel, the leader Briar Queen and 4 Chainrasps whom Nagash has not afforded the dignity of names). Both of these warbands are Easy To Build, with no glue necessary and a comprehensive, easy to follow construction guide;\n     A 32-page rulebook, including the story of Shadespire\u2019s rise and fall, the opening of the Nightvault, the background of the 2 included warbands and all the rules you need to play \u2013 including new scatter mechanics, rules for resolving magic spells, and the use of lethal hexes, sections of game board that are fatal to those pushed in;\n     An 8-page quick start guide, covering the contents of the box, understanding your cards, movement and attacks, and playing your first game;\n     2 double-sided game boards, featuring hexes and objectives;\n     2 pre-built decks of power and objective cards \u2013 96 in total \u2013 for use with the included warbands;\n     10 double-sided Fighter cards, providing the stats and information needed for the fighters in each warband at a glance;\n     5 attack dice, 3 defence dice and 3 magic dice;\n     11 double-sided objective tokens;\n     A scatter template;\n     30 wound tokens;\n     46 double-sided glory point tokens;\n     15 double-sided move and charge tokens;\n     15 Guard tokens;\n     8 activation counters.\n\n\nExtra Rules\n\nWarhammer Underworlds has an intense, fast and fun core ruleset, but the book contains a host of extras - new game modes, competitive and multiplayer rules:\n\n\n     Matched Play: designed for competitive play, this is a set of rules that level the playing field to the finest degree \u2013 perfect for fast, friendly rivalries and tournaments;\n     Multiplayer games: extra rules that allow you to combine 2 core sets of Warhammer Underworlds to create 3-or-4-player games, with clarified rules for resolving attacks and adjustments to victory conditions.\n\n\nAlso included is a glossary for quick and easy reference and a sample chapter of The Mirrored City, a Black Library novel set in Shadespire.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "320116", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Beastgrave \u2013 Arena Mortis"}, {"id": "295263", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Beastgrave \u2013 Champions of Dreadfane"}, {"id": "301924", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Beastgrave \u2013 Hrothgorn's Mantrappers"}, {"id": "295259", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Beastgrave \u2013 Rippa's Snarlfangs"}, {"id": "292731", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Beastgrave \u2013 The Grymwatch"}, {"id": "301925", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Beastgrave \u2013 The Wurmspat"}, {"id": "275255", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Forbidden Chambers Board Pack"}, {"id": "262906", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Garrek\u2019s Reavers"}, {"id": "271910", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Godsworn Hunt"}, {"id": "262908", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Mirrored City Boards Pack"}, {"id": "271911", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Mollog's Mob"}, {"id": "284645", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Power Unbound"}, {"id": "262907", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Steelheart\u2019s Champions"}, {"id": "262903", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 The Eyes of the Nine"}, {"id": "279551", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Thundrik's Profiteers"}, {"id": "279552", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Ylthari's Guardians"}, {"id": "262902", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault \u2013 Zarbag's Gitz"}, {"id": "269409", "name": "Warhammer Underworlds: White Dwarf Exclusive Chaos Gargant"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 781, "average": 7.96042, "bayesaverage": 6.27886, "stddev": 1.34734, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2226, "trading": 40, "wanting": 42, "wishing": 204, "numcomments": 139, "numweights": 17, "averageweight": 2.4118, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1450}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 6, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "2": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 0}}}, "usersrated": 781.0, "average": 7.96042, "bayesaverage": 6.27886, "stddev": 1.34734, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2226.0, "trading": 40.0, "wanting": 42.0, "wishing": 204.0, "numcomments": 139.0, "numweights": 17.0, "averageweight": 2.4118, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1450}], "game_family": "Warhammer Underworlds", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 18, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "266507", "name": "Clank!

Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.\n\nThe aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions.

First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a \"Bang!\" or a \"Click! Click!\" card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on \"Three\" each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.\n\nEveryone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a \"Bang!\" takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table \u2014 money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a \"Bang!\" card to your hand) \u2014 until everything has been claimed.\n\nAfter eight rounds, the game ends.

Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.\n\nIn the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.\n\nAfter each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King's demands, which change each game.

Since Harley Quinn usually follows wherever the Joker goes, each round, one player may receive a location card with a Harley image; if they do, they try to feed the Joker player information about the location, even if they don't know that player\u2019s identity! If the Joker player guesses the location, the two collaborators each score points \u2014 unless the superheroes can turn the tables on them and determine who Harley is.\n\nThe game includes two multiverse decks that contain eight different locations instead of only one, so players will be confused with some of the questions and answers. Keep in mind that no one at the table knows whether or not they are playing with a multiverse deck.

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.\n\nTicket to Ride: Rails & Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)\n\nSimilarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.\n\nSome tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.\n\nEach player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.\n\nTicket to Ride: Rails & Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.\n\nPart of Ticket to Ride series.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "224473", "name": "Bay of Bengal (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)"}, {"id": "220770", "name": "Black Sea (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails)"}, {"id": "219506", "name": "Mediterranean (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride: Rails and Sails)"}, {"id": "89848", "name": "Ticket to Ride: Alvin & Dexter"}, {"id": "53383", "name": "Ticket to Ride: Europa 1912"}, {"id": "225114", "name": "Yellow Sea (fan expansion of Ticket to Ride Rails and Sails)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 2806, "average": 7.39937, "bayesaverage": 6.66463, "stddev": 1.46105, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6029, "trading": 61, "wanting": 230, "wishing": 1173, "numcomments": 484, "numweights": 56, "averageweight": 2.5536, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 758}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 156}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 29, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "2": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "3": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 15}}}, "usersrated": 2806.0, "average": 7.39937, "bayesaverage": 6.66463, "stddev": 1.46105, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6029.0, "trading": 61.0, "wanting": 230.0, "wishing": 1173.0, "numcomments": 484.0, "numweights": 56.0, "averageweight": 2.5536, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 758}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 156}], "game_family": "Ticket to Ride", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "282524", "name": "Horrified", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoClIcwjDo_iZs0idVikDw__thumb/img/YSf5Z99aBqAlNKaGBj_oGb1oKH4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4848330.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoClIcwjDo_iZs0idVikDw__original/img/oGKxUavbTR49i-P6O-WUyBfuRYs=/0x0/pic4848330.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Books: Dracula", "Characters: Frankenstein", "Creatures: Monsters", "Creatures: Werewolves", "Movies: Horror Movies", "Movies: Universal Studios Monsters", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Horror", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Setup"], "designers": ["Prospero Hall"], "artists": ["Prospero Hall"], "publishers": ["Ravensburger"], "description": "The stakes have been raised.

With the goal of obtaining favor with the King, the guilds will gather together the most prestigious personages within them, not to mention those who can bring the largest influx of money or useful talent.\n\nWhat better place than the central square to find new members? For this reason, each guild places its tents in the central square every week, inviting the persons it considers most interesting to sign up by incentivizing them with precious gifts. This is certainly not a low-cost operation considering that it can cost many pieces of silver to put together the most convincing gift.\n\nAt the same time, each guild must build its headquarters, spending large amounts of gold to enlarge it with a range of luxurious rooms suitable for its members; if this were not enough, the guilds must also take into account the King's current tastes on what is most important for a guild worthy of his approval.\n\nWill you manage to make your guild stand out so that it becomes the most important in the city?

The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully.

If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.

In the beginning, each caravan consists of three cards that are spread out vertically so that the top part of each card is visible; each card stands for a caravan member with different abilities.\n\nOn his turn, a player performs only one action, choosing one of the cards on top of the three families and executing one action shown on that card. Then the card is put at the back of its caravan. To use the same caravan member again, a player must first use all the other cards on top of that caravan row.\n\nThese actions can influence the player's stock of spice, gold and mules. To keep track of that stock, each player has his own board with wooden markers that are moved accordingly. Actions can also bring new members to the caravans and can enable the player to fulfill one of four delivery request cards from the middle of the table. Finally, there are actions that mix things up a bit, such as by getting rid of a caravan member or even influencing other players' caravans.\n\nThe game ends when one player has earned 25 points by collecting character cards and fulfilling delivery request cards.\n\nThe core mechanism of Kashgar could be called \"open deck-building\". The game plays quickly with little downtime. After having learned the different actions of the cards, players can start trying out different strategies and combinations of caravan members, caravan sizes, etc.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 1775, "average": 7.13877, "bayesaverage": 6.37959, "stddev": 1.19378, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2440, "trading": 88, "wanting": 205, "wishing": 759, "numcomments": 450, "numweights": 65, "averageweight": 2.2462, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1228}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 623}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 30, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "2": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 9}}}, "usersrated": 1775.0, "average": 7.13877, "bayesaverage": 6.37959, "stddev": 1.19378, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2440.0, "trading": 88.0, "wanting": 205.0, "wishing": 759.0, "numcomments": 450.0, "numweights": 65.0, "averageweight": 2.2462, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1228}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 623}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "146278", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends", "alternative_names": ["Die Arena von Tash-Kalar", "Tash Kalar: Arena de Leyendas", "Tash-Kalar: Ar\u00e9na Legend", "Tash-Kalar: L'Arena Leggendaria", "Tash-Kalar: L'Ar\u00e8ne Des L\u00e9gendes", "Tash-Kalar: Legendarna Arena", "\u30bf\u30b7\u30e5=\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30eb\uff1a\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u95d8\u6280\u5834", "\u5854\u4ec0-\u5361\u62c9\u723e\uff1a\u50b3\u5947\u7af6\u6280\u5834"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/woifEuhjEe-0VPKtPcwaIw__thumb/img/PwCqGHn47oqbKt7aJdkhKb4JG_A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1875045.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/woifEuhjEe-0VPKtPcwaIw__original/img/EyHuMCH9aOjM69FfDdechWPhW10=/0x0/pic1875045.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Tash-Kalar"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Catch the Leader", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Highest-Lowest Scoring", "Pattern Building", "Team-Based Game", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Vlaada Chv\u00e1til"], "artists": ["David Cochard"], "publishers": ["Czech Games Edition", "Cranio Creations", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby Japan", "IELLO", "One Moment Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "REXhry", "Z-Man Games, Inc.", "Zacatrus"], "description": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends is a game played by masters of magic. Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent\u2019s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.\n\nThe game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings \u2013 or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.\n\nTash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.\n\nIn melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.\n\nThe rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "235803", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Etherweave"}, {"id": "165524", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Everfrost"}, {"id": "169370", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Legendary Summoner Promo"}, {"id": "266580", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Love Elemental Promo Card"}, {"id": "180484", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Nethervoid"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 5952, "average": 7.18471, "bayesaverage": 6.82265, "stddev": 1.53134, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7817, "trading": 283, "wanting": 278, "wishing": 1652, "numcomments": 1229, "numweights": 277, "averageweight": 2.8448, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 547}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 38}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 347}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 134, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 68}, "2": {"best_rating": 115, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 58, "not_recommended_rating": 31}, "4": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 64}}}, "usersrated": 5952.0, "average": 7.18471, "bayesaverage": 6.82265, "stddev": 1.53134, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7817.0, "trading": 283.0, "wanting": 278.0, "wishing": 1652.0, "numcomments": 1229.0, "numweights": 277.0, "averageweight": 2.8448, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 547}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 38}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 347}], "game_family": "Tash-Kalar", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "140934", "name": "Arboretum", "alternative_names": ["Arbor\u00e9tum", "\u0410\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0443\u043c", "\u6811\u6728\u56ed", "\uc218\ubaa9\uc6d0"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__thumb/img/X6V1M2nZOinTgwE0KIBfup_QrCw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4172124.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__original/img/sJFGZGYrOXrjOL5fHI-uVkpJmEU=/0x0/pic4172124.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Draw and Discard", "Series: Deluxe card game (Z-Man / Filosofia)", "Theme: Nature", "Theme: Trees and Forests"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Pattern Building", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Dan Cassar"], "artists": ["Philippe Gu\u00e9rin", "Chris Quilliams", "Beth Sobel", "Waldo Ramirez"], "publishers": ["Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Renegade Game Studios", "Z-Man Games, Inc.", "ABACUSSPIELE", "Banana Games", "Fractal Juegos", "Gen-X Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lavka Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "TLAMA games", "Vagabund"], "description": "Arboretum is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, aged 10 and up, that combines set collection, tile-laying and hand management while playing in about 25 minutes. Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.\n\nThe deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.\n\nWhen the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color. Whoever has the most points wins.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 12462, "average": 7.39952, "bayesaverage": 7.17242, "stddev": 1.21567, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21440, "trading": 311, "wanting": 644, "wishing": 3815, "numcomments": 2687, "numweights": 367, "averageweight": 2.1526, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 248}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 41}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 226, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 106}, "2": {"best_rating": 107, "recommended_rating": 84, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "3": {"best_rating": 68, "recommended_rating": 103, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 59, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 94}}}, "usersrated": 12462.0, "average": 7.39952, "bayesaverage": 7.17242, "stddev": 1.21567, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21440.0, "trading": 311.0, "wanting": 644.0, "wishing": 3815.0, "numcomments": 2687.0, "numweights": 367.0, "averageweight": 2.1526, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 248}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 41}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "198454", "name": "When I Dream", "alternative_names": ["\u00c1lmodj Velem!", "Kdy\u017e sn\u00edm", "Kraina sn\u00f3w", "Lumea Viselor", "\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043d\u0456\u0432", "\u05d1\u05d7\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9", "\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e17\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1d\u0e31\u0e19", "\u79c1\u304c\u5922\u307f\u308b\u3068\u304d \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7248", "\u8aaa\u5922\u4eba", "\uafc8\uc758 \ub300\ud654"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/E7bmvTXE2dWskxFaMwXYrA__thumb/img/aR_FTYkNL8LoAijfVLmlblrUs5w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3747128.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/E7bmvTXE2dWskxFaMwXYrA__original/img/8gezS6pP6rV7mhdbZd7lwj7pI0I=/0x0/pic3747128.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Blindfolds / Blackout Glasses", "Components: Game Trayz Inside", "Theme: Dreams / Nightmares", "Word Games: Guess the Word"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Party Game", "Real-time", "Word Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Communication Limits", "Memory", "Role Playing", "Storytelling", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": ["Chris Darsaklis"], "artists": ["Jonathan Aucomte", "\u00c9ric Azagury", "Cyrille Bertin", "Lo\u00efc Billiau", "S\u00e9bastien Caiveau", "Miguel Coimbra", "Ma\u00ebva da Silva", "Julien Delval", "Christine Deschamps", "Vincent Dutrait", "Nicolas Fructus", "Anne Heidsieck", "Ga\u00ebl Lannurien", "Fred Navez", "Cyril Nouvel", "Isma\u00ebl Pommaz", "Christophe Swal", "R\u00e9gis Torres"], "publishers": ["Drawlab Entertainment", "Repos Production", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "GoKids \u73a9\u6a02\u5c0f\u5b50", "Hobby Japan", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Siam Board Games", "Sombreros Production", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433", "\u05e4\u05e8\u05e9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d7\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd - Game Knight"], "description": "The night has fallen and your mind is floating in the magical world of dreams.

Become the dreamer, put on your sleeping mask and try to figure out your dream and which spirits are the Naughty ones. Become a good spirit and help the Dreamer by giving him clues about the dream before the naughty spirits mess it up. Close your eyes and dive in!\n\nAt the beginning of each round of When I Dream one player takes the role of the Dreamer and \"falls asleep\", wearing a cloth mask. The other players are secretly dealt their role cards determining what kind of spirits they are \"good\" or  \"naughty\" or if they are just \"tricksters\" changing sides as the game goes by.\n\nThe whole round lasts 120 seconds in which the spirits are drawing \"Dream\" cards depicting a specific element of the dream, trying to describe them to the dreamer using one word each. The dreamer can guess what the element of the Dream is at any time, placing the card to the good spirits team side if the guess was correct and in the naughty spirits pile if it was not. \nAt the end of the round the Dreamer and the good spirits get a point for every card in the good spirits pile, when the naughty spirits get one point for every card in the naughty spirits pile. The tricksters get points according to how well balanced the two teams were at the end of the round, gaining extra points if they managed to equally balance the two piles.\n\nAt the end of the round, the dreamer must use the words he guessed and story-tell his dream for extra points before he opens his eyes.\n\nYou can learn how to play in a few minutes and have a great laugh right from the start.

Even the greatest kingdoms begin as small townships, therefore players begin with only a basic town hall, a couple of peons, and a single warrior. From there, players must explore the territory around them, build up their work force, fortify their army, and develop their kingdom \u2014 all through careful action selection, exploitation, war, and resource management.\n\nAs players reach milestones in the development of their kingdom, they gain access to many advantages. Peons become warriors, warriors become powerful heroes, and town halls eventually become castles. Players gain access to water, and even air, vessels and creatures. Boarding these vessels and creatures with your units allows for faster travel across the vast game board and for positioning armies for powerful attacks.\n\nWar in Heroes of Land, Air & Sea features a cost/reward system carefully detailed on tactics cards from which players must secretly choose. The availability of these tactics cards depends on the units participating in the war. It is here that players wage their wits and legacy in an attempt to exterminate one another. For as we all know, \"history is written by the victors\".\n\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea also boasts two economic systems, one being the risky acquisition and careful management of the resources (food, ore and mana), while the other is a twist on worker placement that requires the leveraging of peons to construct buildings, peons that could otherwise be exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating! Finding this balance is crucial to victory!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "248268", "name": "Heroes of Land, Air & Sea: Mercenaries Expansion Pack #1"}, {"id": "248269", "name": "Heroes of Land, Air & Sea: Mercenaries Expansion Pack #2"}, {"id": "274789", "name": "Heroes of Land, Air & Sea: Mercenaries Expansion Pack #3"}, {"id": "248273", "name": "Heroes of Land, Air & Sea: Nomads Mini-Expansion"}, {"id": "226407", "name": "Heroes of Land, Air & Sea: Order and Chaos"}, {"id": "253638", "name": "Heroes of Land, Air & Sea: Pestilence"}, {"id": "274790", "name": "Heroes of Land, Air & Sea: Pestilence Booster Pack"}, {"id": "248271", "name": "Heroes of Land, Air & Sea: Siege Engines Mini-Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 2030, "average": 7.70614, "bayesaverage": 6.68387, "stddev": 1.59645, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4118, "trading": 74, "wanting": 326, "wishing": 1850, "numcomments": 528, "numweights": 73, "averageweight": 3.2192, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 733}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 383}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 42, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 6}}}, "usersrated": 2030.0, "average": 7.70614, "bayesaverage": 6.68387, "stddev": 1.59645, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4118.0, "trading": 74.0, "wanting": 326.0, "wishing": 1850.0, "numcomments": 528.0, "numweights": 73.0, "averageweight": 3.2192, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 733}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 383}], "game_family": "Heroes of Land, Air & Sea", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "137330", "name": "Cube Quest", "alternative_names": ["KingBrick", "Rumms", "\ud050\ube0c \ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CcIddP6uVQrQl4MznemKng__thumb/img/jjm6vpsC6GZ53SUh3Hrid_vGuy0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4009094.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CcIddP6uVQrQl4MznemKng__original/img/kRkpRcMnSSbmRiX3DpwbhEbbZqw=/0x0/pic4009094.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Mechanism: Finger Flicking Games", "Players: Two Player Only Games"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "Dice", "Fighting"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Flicking", "Pattern Building"], "designers": ["Oliver Sibthorpe", "Gary Sibthorpe"], "artists": ["Jonathan Kirtz"], "publishers": ["Gamewright", "(Self-Published)", "KOSMOS"], "description": "Cube Quest is a dexterity game in which lightweight hollow cubic dice are flicked across custom rubber mats.

Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.\n\nWhy would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper \u2014 but at the risk of ending up with nothing.\n\nAll editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path.

Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team.\u00a0\nYou can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.\nK2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike.\nThe box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "105059", "name": "K2: Broad Peak"}, {"id": "257817", "name": "K2: Lhotse"}, {"id": "120600", "name": "K2: The Avalanche"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 8894, "average": 7.06739, "bayesaverage": 6.81818, "stddev": 1.23138, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9569, "trading": 219, "wanting": 609, "wishing": 2357, "numcomments": 1707, "numweights": 543, "averageweight": 2.2652, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 550}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 161}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 132}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 168, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 82, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "2": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 93, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "3": {"best_rating": 77, "recommended_rating": 43, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 70, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 22, "recommended_rating": 61, "not_recommended_rating": 19}, "5+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 58}}}, "usersrated": 8894.0, "average": 7.06739, "bayesaverage": 6.81818, "stddev": 1.23138, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9569.0, "trading": 219.0, "wanting": 609.0, "wishing": 2357.0, "numcomments": 1707.0, "numweights": 543.0, "averageweight": 2.2652, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 550}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 161}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 132}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "127023", "name": "Kemet", "alternative_names": ["\u041a\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmZjhy7_6REp8IaXh9Zqwg__thumb/img/930_NppLsnIGUDG_W6wkdOGgKR8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3979527.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmZjhy7_6REp8IaXh9Zqwg__original/img/rjuKOHsH4_EayHV5jflH0LMpwqI=/0x0/pic3979527.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Country: Egypt", "Creatures: Monsters", "Game: Kemet", "Mythology: Egyptian", "Theme: Deserts"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Mythology", "Wargame"], "implementations": ["Kemet: Blood and Sand"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Card Play Conflict Resolution", "Hand Management"], "designers": ["Jacques Bariot", "Guillaume Montiage"], "artists": ["Dimitri Bielak", "\u00c9mile Denis", "Nicolas Fructus"], "publishers": ["Matagot", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Bureau de Juegos", "CrowD Games", "Funiverse", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Pegasus Spiele", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Surfin' Meeple China"], "description": "In Kemet, players each deploy the troops of an Egyptian tribe and use the mystical powers of the gods of ancient Egypt \u2013 along with their powerful armies \u2013 to score points in glorious battles or through invasion of rich territories.

To earn this title, you must complete dangerous scenarios in the shortest possible time frame. The most innovative element of the game is that the player uses their own 30-second sand timer as a character to be placed on the ship to perform actions. Each time a player places their own sand timer, they have to wait for the sand to run out to be able to perform the action needed. Each hole in the ship represents an area where you can perform a specific action: turning the ship, loading cannons, shooting enemy ships, repairing damage, and so forth...\n\nA Tale of Pirates (previously announced as Admiral of the Black) has ten different scenarios, ranging from ordinary pirating activities like looking and shooting, to kraken-hunting, prison breaks, treasure hunts, and much more. An app for any smartphone or tablet will lead the players along the missions, assist with scenario data, random events, multiple paths, upgrades, and gamestate-saving for later sessions. It also serves as a timer for the individual round as the typical scenario lasts 2-3 rounds, each five minutes long.\n\nThe players have to react to events and maneuver the ship to fight enemy gunboats, catch rich merchant vessels, and avoid other obstacles. They must communicate to agree and organize things to do, but they have to be quick because time is always ticking.\n\nA Tale of Pirates is swift playing with simple rules, but it's exciting and involving, with great interactions among players.

The first game in the series, Awakening the Bear! \u2013 Russia 1941-1942, takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.\n\nConflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames. The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units. This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time.\n\nMuch effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, each tank defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training. All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system.\n\nThe included firefights, most of which you can play in about an hour, are designed to depict the pivotal points in a given battle. You can learn enough of the game to play the first scenario in ten minutes thanks to the programmed instruction approach used in the full-color rulebook.\n\nThe game also features three- and four-player firefights and optional rules for solitaire play.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "38216", "name": "Conflict of Heroes: Marsh Map Missions"}, {"id": "132027", "name": "Conflict of Heroes: Monster Tanks of the Eastern Front"}, {"id": "45132", "name": "Conflict of Heroes: Price of Honour \u2013 Poland 1939"}, {"id": "132026", "name": "Conflict of Heroes: Wrecks and Destruction on the Eastern Front"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2008, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 2959, "average": 7.51866, "bayesaverage": 6.79443, "stddev": 1.51146, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3872, "trading": 223, "wanting": 187, "wishing": 975, "numcomments": 1011, "numweights": 467, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 581}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 76}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 81, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 21}, "2": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "4": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 33}}}, "usersrated": 2959.0, "average": 7.51866, "bayesaverage": 6.79443, "stddev": 1.51146, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3872.0, "trading": 223.0, "wanting": 187.0, "wishing": 975.0, "numcomments": 1011.0, "numweights": 467.0, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 581}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 76}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "37046", "name": "Ghost Stories", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mfoj66t524ZS5DKMZJlUYQ__thumb/img/gU9MeF5k_g-Go3GXqh3GPsucsRY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1790243.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mfoj66t524ZS5DKMZJlUYQ__original/img/Bq2ZwuE3S3RHZ4YA5yHmnrYn96Q=/0x0/pic1790243.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Tower Defense", "Components: Miniatures", "Creatures: Ghosts", "Game: Ghost Stories", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Fighting", "Horror", "Mythology"], "implementations": ["Last Bastion"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Move Through Deck", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Antoine Bauza"], "artists": ["Pier\u00f4"], "publishers": ["Repos Production", "Asmodee", "Lautapelit.fi", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell \u2013 Wu-Feng \u2013 and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.\n\nThe players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own \u2013 some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.\n\nTo exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.\n\nTo win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.\n\nThere are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "59967", "name": "Ghost Stories: B-Rice Lee"}, {"id": "160481", "name": "Ghost Stories: Band of Brothers"}, {"id": "95699", "name": "Ghost Stories: Black Secret"}, {"id": "54833", "name": "Ghost Stories: Chuck No-Rice"}, {"id": "123920", "name": "Ghost Stories: Crazy Shaman"}, {"id": "166161", "name": "Ghost Stories: Guard Tower"}, {"id": "69467", "name": "Ghost Stories: Jean-Claude Van Rice"}, {"id": "185242", "name": "Ghost Stories: Promo Pack"}, {"id": "39428", "name": "Ghost Stories: The Guardhouse Expansion"}, {"id": "110906", "name": "Ghost Stories: The Infernal Die"}, {"id": "47616", "name": "Ghost Stories: White Moon"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2008, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 19173, "average": 7.32492, "bayesaverage": 7.15969, "stddev": 1.41704, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25149, "trading": 609, "wanting": 808, "wishing": 5566, "numcomments": 4236, "numweights": 993, "averageweight": 2.9104, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 259}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 84}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 206}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 342, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 69, "recommended_rating": 143, "not_recommended_rating": 55}, "2": {"best_rating": 53, "recommended_rating": 180, "not_recommended_rating": 39}, "3": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 183, "not_recommended_rating": 47}, "4": {"best_rating": 237, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 144}}}, "usersrated": 19173.0, "average": 7.32492, "bayesaverage": 7.15969, "stddev": 1.41704, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25149.0, "trading": 609.0, "wanting": 808.0, "wishing": 5566.0, "numcomments": 4236.0, "numweights": 993.0, "averageweight": 2.9104, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 259}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 84}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 206}], "game_family": "Ghost Stories", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 11, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "257067", "name": "Magnastorm", "alternative_names": ["\u30de\u30b0\u30ca\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30e0", "\u746a\u683c\u7d0d\u98a8\u66b4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tWIrpGrKEj9O7Pa8brQ1kg__thumb/img/jgP_2uztioEd4zibt0LjAL_HqFc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4252589.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tWIrpGrKEj9O7Pa8brQ1kg__original/img/oOOFtRUrGQjf5vJ5CNFNAVMmaxw=/0x0/pic4252589.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Exploration", "Science Fiction", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Bauldric & Friends"], "artists": ["Michael Menzel"], "publishers": ["Feuerland Spiele", "Cranio Creations", "Mandala Jogos", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)", "Toy Box Games"], "description": "When the first exploration vessels entered the cloudy atmosphere of the planet Magnastorm, they discovered not only evidence of abundant natural resources, but also the remains of a long-lost civilization. At the bidding of the magistracy, scout vehicles are lowered to the barren surface to search for suitable mining areas.\n\nThe goal of Magnastorm is to be the first player with a certain number of reputation points. You acquire reputation mostly through fulfilling objectives, taking control of one or more of the eight commanders, and building transmitter stations. The flow of the game is controlled by an action board with two action panels, each of which has five columns. At the start of each round, there are a 3-5 action tokens (crew members) standing in each column on the upper action panel. To carry out an action, a player:\n\nA) takes an action token from the upper panel and places it on the lower action panel either to gain resources or to pay for a movement on the planet surface, or\n B) pays for every action token still standing in a certain column on the upper panel to gain control over the commander and his ability at the top of that panel, after which the player places those action tokens on the lower panel.\n\nSince option A) will reduce the cost for option B), the players have to find the right timing for their actions. A round ends when the upper panel is empty. For the next round, the panels are swapped.\n\nMagnastorm is a big, tactical board game with very little luck. Choose the right moment to perform actions or buy influence over helpful commanders. You will reap success through resource management, clever logistics, good timing, and a shrewd eye on the actions of your opponents.

Players rolls six dice instead of five and there are now different combos to mitigate against tough zombie-filled rolls. Additionally, players can now use followers to soak damage coming in from zombies.\n\nThe game ends either when one player dies, the Town Line comes out of the locations deck, or when the Mutant Zombie has been put down once and for all.

On a turn, a player must choose a card from the display, taking the bricks from it and paying a brick to every card skipped. There is an opportunity to exchange three bricks for one on display before the player works in their construction site. Players can have multiple towers under construction at once. However, for every brick they wish to add on a turn, there is an extra cost, and if any towers are not built upon during a turn, then they are torn down as abandoned construction. Players must pay attention to other projects so that commissions they were counting on are not snatched away before they can claim them.\n\nThis game won the second prize at the \"Hippodice e.V.

Under constant threat of storm and flood, communities here rally together to build dikes that keep the rising water at bay. But every citizen constructing a dike is one fewer citizen tending flocks and maintaining the family farm. The residents here are constantly torn between selflessness and self-interest, and only those who can strike this delicate balance can thrive in this harsh landscape.\n\nIn Lowlands, you carve your farm out of this unforgiving land, gathering and spending resource cards to transform your farmyard into pastures that allow you to profit from breeding sheep. Adding expansions to your farm will unlock new options and score you victory points, but helping to build the dike that collectively protects all players is also rewarded. No matter what, the tide will rise and, if the dike isn't high enough, it could rush in and sweep away your hard-earned profits. Will you sacrifice your own farm for the good of the community, or will you pursue your own agenda? The choice is yours.\n\nEven without the poor weather, life on a farm is one of constant work where you find yourself tending flocks of sheep, extending their pastures, and looking for the right moment to sell them for a profit. To complete all these tasks, Lowlands gives you a group of farmers that you can assign to various tasks around your farm. To get the most out of them, you must think strategically, deciding which actions you want to take and the best time to take them. Once they've been assigned, your farmers help you build a bustling farm where there was once scrubby bushes, trees, and lakes. You begin the game with only two sheep and a small pasture, but your farmyard is rife with possibilities, its many empty spaces inviting you to customize your farm as you see fit.\n\nWhile you could simply focus on creating more area for your sheep to roam, the game also provides plenty of options for customizing your farm with various buildings and features. Not only are these tiles worth victory points at the end of the game, they also make your farm more efficient and more profitable. You might add a feeding trough to your farm, for example, to immediately earn another sheep and the ability to house two sheep per pasture space instead of just one. Or you could construct a lake cabin on your property to get away from it all for a bit. While this tile doesn't give you any special abilities, it increases the value in victory points of the farmyard spaces immediately adjacent to it. Ultimately, you are free to pursue whatever strategy you see fit, building a farm wholly your own.\n\nOn top of the challenges of building a successful farm, of course, you also have to deal with the tempestuous weather that comes with living on the wave-battered coast of the North Sea. Here, the tides always seem to rise a little higher, threatening to take a dent out of your profits by sweeping away some of your flock. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you always have the opportunity to send your farmers to contribute to the dike instead of working on your farm. When you do, you also commit resources to creating dike elements that are added to the board as a buffer against the rising waters. Add enough of these pieces and you might prevent disaster for everyone. The tide turns repeatedly, bringing with it new flood pieces. If there are enough dike elements in place to hold back the rising waters, players' farms are spared. If the dike breaks, however, you could be forced to take dike breach tokens that have adverse effects at the end of the game.\n\nWhile lending a hand with the dike at the expense of your own farm is certainly a nice gesture that keeps everyone safe from the floodwaters, it has rewards of its own. For each resource you contribute to the dike, you advance one step up the dike track. Not only does advancing far enough on this track grant victory points, it also amplifies your reward if the dike holds and lessens the blow when it breaks. It is in your best interest, then, to keep pace with other players on the dike in order to protect your investments back home one the farm.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "256951", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018"}, {"id": "264041", "name": "Lowlands: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018 Promo"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 100, "minplaytime": 50, "maxplaytime": 100, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 1938, "average": 7.45186, "bayesaverage": 6.58991, "stddev": 1.20843, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3144, "trading": 67, "wanting": 410, "wishing": 1571, "numcomments": 387, "numweights": 64, "averageweight": 3.0156, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 865}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 450}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 47, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 19}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "3": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 12}}}, "usersrated": 1938.0, "average": 7.45186, "bayesaverage": 6.58991, "stddev": 1.20843, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3144.0, "trading": 67.0, "wanting": 410.0, "wishing": 1571.0, "numcomments": 387.0, "numweights": 64.0, "averageweight": 3.0156, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 865}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 450}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "151347", "name": "Millennium Blades", "alternative_names": ["\u5343\u5e74\u4e4b\u5203"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fqNRfH1NRnnhiIJisZjEoQ__thumb/img/88CPRQuwAZN7TCr9UYNKkLT3SGQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2468179.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fqNRfH1NRnnhiIJisZjEoQ__original/img/TWnjacQUXsFasgimixAHI8dxqxg=/0x0/pic2468179.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Theme: Boardgaming"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Real-time"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Commodity Speculation", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Simulation", "Trading"], "designers": ["D.

The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background.  By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics.  The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation's government and decides what the nation will do.  As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.  As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return.

During a turn, you ask for information about two different references in which you are interested. The rest of the players can offer you cards that contain the requested references, and you can trade for those cards by giving the offering players the same number of points they have offered via cards in your hand.\n\nAfter each round ends, players can try to solve the mystery.

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.\n\nRoot represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.\n\nThe Cats play a game of engine building and logistics while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to produce workshops, lumber mills, and barracks. They win by building new buildings and crafts.\n\nThe Eyrie musters their hawks to take back the Woods. They must capture as much territory as possible and build roosts before they collapse back into squabbling.\n\nThe Alliance hides in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies.

After three ages of play, whoever has collected the most glory wins!\n\nIn more detail, the land of Ethnos contains twelve tribes of fantasy creatures, and in each game you choose six of them (five in a 2/3-player game), then create a deck with only the creatures in those tribes. The cards come in six colors, which match the six regions of Ethnos. Place three glory tokens in each region at random, arranging them from low to high.\n\nEach player starts the game with one card in hand, then 4-12 cards (double the number of players) are placed face up on the table. On a turn, a player either recruits an ally or plays a band of allies. In the former case, you take a face-up card (without replacing it from the deck) or the top card of the deck and add it to your hand. In the latter case, you choose a set of cards in your hand that match either in tribe or in color, play them in front of you on the table, then discard all other cards in hand. You then place one token in the region that matches the color of the top card just played, and you use the power of the tribe member on the top card just played.\n\nAt the end of the first age, whoever has the most tokens in a region scores the glory shown on the first token. After the second age, the players with the most and second most tokens score glory equal to the values shown on the first and second tokens respectively. Players score similarly after the third age, then whoever has the most glory wins. (Games with two and three players last only two ages.)\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "226318", "name": "Ethnos: Promo Tribe \u2013 Fairies"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 9461, "average": 7.48068, "bayesaverage": 7.18658, "stddev": 1.21803, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11780, "trading": 217, "wanting": 574, "wishing": 2684, "numcomments": 1670, "numweights": 166, "averageweight": 2.0301, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 240}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 164}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 149, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 81}, "2": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 54, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "3": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 78, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4": {"best_rating": 83, "recommended_rating": 31, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "6": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 65, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 50}}}, "usersrated": 9461.0, "average": 7.48068, "bayesaverage": 7.18658, "stddev": 1.21803, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11780.0, "trading": 217.0, "wanting": 574.0, "wishing": 2684.0, "numcomments": 1670.0, "numweights": 166.0, "averageweight": 2.0301, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 240}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 164}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "230253", "name": "Star Realms: Frontiers", "alternative_names": ["Star Realms: Fronti\u00e8res", "\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438: \u0424\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-CogwvQ7V19RQH0tE6msFw__thumb/img/mcqeVvpTU9wcnJXkJcVceZv4Z8s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4171533.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-CogwvQ7V19RQH0tE6msFw__original/img/XSThMk6aAzfXk5r7l6123LcInIc=/0x0/pic4171533.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Star Realms", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fighting", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Cooperative Game", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Player Elimination", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Take That"], "designers": ["Robert Dougherty", "Darwin Kastle"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Hobby World", "IELLO", "White Wizard Games"], "description": "Star Realms: Frontiers is a new standalone Star Realms series game with an 80-card trade deck and new scorecards that's suitable for play with up to four players.

Following this new edition, the game went from having only a French edition to having a world-wide edition.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "286086", "name": "Deutscher Spielepreis Classic Goodie Box"}, {"id": "292745", "name": "Just One: Deutscher Spielepreis Classic Goodie Box Promo Cards"}, {"id": "283102", "name": "Just One: Gathering of Friends Promo Cards"}, {"id": "317124", "name": "Just One: Neue Begriffe"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 10578, "average": 7.60889, "bayesaverage": 7.3322, "stddev": 1.16843, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17138, "trading": 101, "wanting": 332, "wishing": 2413, "numcomments": 1541, "numweights": 197, "averageweight": 1.0609, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 166}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 3}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 152, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 111}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 113}, "3": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 87}, "4": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 82, "not_recommended_rating": 35}, "5": {"best_rating": 45, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6": {"best_rating": 104, "recommended_rating": 28, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "7": {"best_rating": 97, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "7+": {"best_rating": 23, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 23}}}, "usersrated": 10578.0, "average": 7.60889, "bayesaverage": 7.3322, "stddev": 1.16843, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17138.0, "trading": 101.0, "wanting": 332.0, "wishing": 2413.0, "numcomments": 1541.0, "numweights": 197.0, "averageweight": 1.0609, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 166}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 3}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "254888", "name": "High Rise", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2-BtabrB2WhfWUS7Xxn-9g__thumb/img/3UB7OOApda-RtdeDaURulGnUymI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4608756.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2-BtabrB2WhfWUS7Xxn-9g__original/img/YN-RCm907IBC2Ckju0767pedfhA=/0x0/pic4608756.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["City Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["End Game Bonuses", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Time Track"], "designers": ["Gil Hova"], "artists": ["Heiko G\u00fcnther", "Kwanchai Moriya"], "publishers": ["Formal Ferret Games"], "description": "High Rise is a strategic city-building game with a bit of corruption.

Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that's fit to view.\n\nAndroid: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.\n\nCorporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with \"ice\". These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.\n\nIn turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.\n\nThe first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.\n\nThe Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs. While the cards in this set have been released previously, the art on some of them is new.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "201553", "name": "Android: Netrunner \u2013 23 Seconds"}, {"id": "135103",

combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).\n\nStar Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat. It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent\u2019s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!\n\nMultiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios. Also, in the newest version, there are new ways to play that allow up to 6 players with modes like Boss, Hunter, and Free for All. You can also add Star Realms Colony Wars to the deck to make it 4 players. This is the first game of the Star Realms series.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFactions\n\nEach of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrade Federation\n\nIn the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation\u2019s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation\u2019s trade and other interests.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Blobs\n\nThese mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, \u201cThe Blobs\u201d. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStar Empire\n\nThe Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMachine Cult\n\nA cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlaying Star Realms\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u2039When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.\n\nAs you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent\u2019s Authority to zero and win the game, it\u2019s also useful for destroying your opponent\u2019s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent\u2019s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent\u2019s Authority directly.\n\nStar Realms is easy to learn, especially if you\u2019re familiar with deck-building games, but it\u2019s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent\u2019s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you\u2019ll be faced with. New players needn\u2019t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.\n\n", "expansions":

With increasingly serious global warming, the last area of ice on land at the North Pole is melting and all the polar bears are homeless. Players in this game will be a team formed by all nations to save them. This is a co-operative game for 1-4 players. Players will co-operate with each other by choosing proper actions and card effects, so that they can save all of the homeless polar bears.\n\nEach player chooses a ship of a nation at the beginning of the game and he or she will be the captain of the ship. Different ships have different abilities, which can be improved during the game. Also, there are various cards of 4 main kinds in this game. Captains start with some of them and they can get or use them during the whole game. Rescue Polar Bears is played in turns. In one captain\u2019s turn, he has several actions to choose, such as moving, delivering and using cards. A captain has 3 action points per turn, which can be used to choose the actions mentioned above.\n\nThe homeless polar bears stand on ices, waiting the captain\u2019s rescue. The ices they stand on is melting with time elapsing, accidentally or step by step. When an ice is melt, the polar bears on it may drop down into the water and face their unlucky fate. So it\u2019s crucial for the captains to co-operate with each other by choosing proper actions and card effects before that tragedy.\n\nThe game can be ended by 3 ways: Saving all polar bears, using up time or having a polar bear fall into the water. You group will get scores, based on your performance, in either ending. Then, share your scores with your friends and families!\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 94, "average": 6.86206, "bayesaverage": 5.57684, "stddev": 1.57057, "median": 0.0, "owned": 149, "trading": 3, "wanting": 21, "wishing": 142, "numcomments": 30, "numweights": 5, "averageweight": 2.8, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 8060}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 2, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}}}, "usersrated": 94.0, "average": 6.86206, "bayesaverage": 5.57684, "stddev": 1.57057, "median": 0.0, "owned": 149.0, "trading": 3.0, "wanting": 21.0, "wishing": 142.0, "numcomments": 30.0, "numweights": 5.0, "averageweight": 2.8, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 8060}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "205637", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game", "alternative_names": ["Arkham Horror: Das Kartenspiel", "Arkham Horror: El Juego de Cartas", "Arkham Horror: Il Gioco di Carte", "Horreur \u00e0 Arkham: Le Jeu de Cartes", "Horror w Arkham: Gra Karciana", "\u0416\u0430\u0445 \u0410\u0440\u043a\u0433\u0435\u043c\u0430: \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u0430", "\u0423\u0436\u0430\u0441 \u0410\u0440\u043a\u0445\u044d\u043c\u0430: \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430", "\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30e0\u30db\u30e9\u30fc \u30b6\u30fb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u8be1\u9547\u5947\u8c08 \u5361\u724c\u7248", "\u9b54\u93ae\u9a5a\u9b42\u5361\u724c\u7248", "\uc544\ucef4 \ud638\ub7ec: \uce74\ub4dc \uac8c\uc784"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B5F5ulz0UivNgrI9Ky0euA__thumb/img/L8ouPl5jv2Ye9MC4R_Os2zSGigE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3122349.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B5F5ulz0UivNgrI9Ky0euA__original/img/EQ0Kl-bH9RCI5aJWVLnAlAfo00E=/0x0/pic3122349.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Collectible: Living Card Game (Fantasy Flight Games)", "Game: Arkham Horror \u2013 The Card Game", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Arkham Horror Files (Fantasy Flight Games)", "Theme: Cthulhu Mythos", "Versions & Editions: Card Versions of Non-Card Games"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Novel-based"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Cooperative Game", "Deck Construction", "Hand Management", "Role Playing", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Nate French", "Matthew Newman"], "artists": ["Christopher Hosch", "Marcin Jakubowski", "Ignacio Baz\u00e1n Lazcano", "Henning Ludvigsen", "Mercedes Opheim", "Zoe Robinson", "Evan Simonet"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "Arclight", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433"], "description": "Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it. Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!\n\nIn the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.\n\nNo matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.\n\nEach of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...\n\nThe basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand \u2014 and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "235542", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 A Phantom of Truth: Mythos Pack"}, {"id": "288607",

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\n\nDuring a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.\n\nAfter a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.\n\nEach month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.\n\nDuring the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.\n\nPart of the Pandemic series\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 40206, "average": 8.6177, "bayesaverage": 8.46773, "stddev": 1.57331, "median": 0.0, "owned": 63218, "trading": 286, "wanting": 830, "wishing": 10544, "numcomments": 6241, "numweights": 1108, "averageweight": 2.8339, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 2}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 626, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 316}, "2": {"best_rating": 104, "recommended_rating": 330, "not_recommended_rating": 78}, "3": {"best_rating": 111, "recommended_rating": 328, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "4": {"best_rating": 371, "recommended_rating": 150, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4+": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 328}}}, "usersrated": 40206.0, "average": 8.6177, "bayesaverage": 8.46773, "stddev": 1.57331, "median": 0.0, "owned": 63218.0, "trading": 286.0, "wanting": 830.0, "wishing": 10544.0, "numcomments": 6241.0, "numweights": 1108.0, "averageweight": 2.8339, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 2}], "game_family": "Pandemic", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "176558", "name": "Mafia de Cuba", "alternative_names": ["Gangs of Cuba", "\u6559\u7236\u98a8\u96f2"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nvdogXld5bIr8uXIq2M-uA__thumb/img/j82wTfCvi4Cjq3Pa3aJDLS1nuRw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2519675.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nvdogXld5bIr8uXIq2M-uA__original/img/IEs6eQ3fnK3y_syC2vgVSjY3aIU=/0x0/pic2519675.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: Havana (Cuba)", "Country: Cuba", "Game: Werewolf / Mafia"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Mafia", "Party Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Role Playing", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Philippe des Palli\u00e8res", "Lo\u00efc Lamy"], "artists": ["Thomas Vuarchex"], "publishers": ["Lui-m\u00eame", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos"], "description": "Havana, December 29, 1955: At the end of the meal offered at his \"faithful\" henchmen, don Alessandro evokes the \"business\" in progress.

In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are \"pig\", \"candy\", \"tent\", and \"son\", then I might say \"Sam-striped-pink\" and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.\n\nStarting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, \"sucker-prince-stake\". The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)\n\nThe rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "249122", "name": "Decrypto: AI Serial \u2013 Bruno Cathala 01"}, {"id": "248872", "name": "Decrypto: AI Serial \u2013 Rob Daviau 01"}, {"id": "273938", "name": "Decrypto: Expansion #01 \u2013 Laserdrive"}, {"id": "280470", "name": "Decrypto: Klingon"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 10812, "average": 7.79398, "bayesaverage": 7.47923, "stddev": 1.2361, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17366, "trading": 125, "wanting": 437, "wishing": 3284, "numcomments": 1545, "numweights": 180, "averageweight": 1.8111, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 105}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 1}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 165, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 109}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 108}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 97}, "4": {"best_rating": 91, "recommended_rating": 55, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "6": {"best_rating": 116, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "7": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 76, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "8": {"best_rating": 34, "recommended_rating": 69, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "8+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 72}}}, "usersrated": 10812.0, "average": 7.79398, "bayesaverage": 7.47923, "stddev": 1.2361, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17366.0, "trading": 125.0, "wanting": 437.0, "wishing": 3284.0, "numcomments": 1545.0, "numweights": 180.0, "averageweight": 1.8111, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 105}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 1}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD & DT"}, {"id": "239188", "name": "Chronicles of Crime", "alternative_names": ["B\u0171n\u00fcgyi Kr\u00f3nik\u00e1k", "Cr\u00f3nicas del Crimen", "Kronika zlo\u010dinu", "Kroniki zbrodni", "\u03a4\u03bf \u03a7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u0395\u03b3\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2", "\u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f", "\u63a8\u7406\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7c3f Chronicles of Crime", "\uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1BMyuEwK0zV9005oYinYLw__thumb/img/QFzbDlFGzK3yRZNLnRr4YzHwEuY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4317519.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1BMyuEwK0zV9005oYinYLw__original/img/JRE8PpskKmoIQ3R5WZZUOy7nQLw=/0x0/pic4317519.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Digital Hybrid - App Required", "Components: Official Music Soundtrack", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Chronicles of Crime", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Mystery / Crime"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "implementations": ["Chronicles of Crime: 1400", "Chronicles of Crime: 1900", "Chronicles of Crime: 2400"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Storytelling"], "designers": ["David Cicurel"], "artists": ["David Cicurel", "Matijos Gebreselassie", "Mateusz Komada", "Katarzyna Kosobucka"], "publishers": ["Lucky Duck Games", "999 Games", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Corax Games", "FoxGames", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Game Harbor", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hobby World", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Last Level", "MINDOK", "Outland", "TWOPLUS Games", "uplay.it edizioni"], "description": "Chronicles of Crime is a cooperative game of crime investigation, mixing an app, a board game and a touch of Virtual Reality.\n\nWith the same physical components (board, locations, characters and items), players will be able to play plenty of different scenarios and solve as many different crime stories.\n\nPlayers start the app, choose the scenario they want to play, and follow the story.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.\n\nIt's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.\n\nYou can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.\n\nCaverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "154204", "name": "Caverna: Christmas Chamber"}, {"id": "160803", "name": "Caverna: LARP and Cosplay Postcard"}, {"id": "166187", "name": "Caverna: Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "245932", "name": "Caverna: The Forgotten Folk"}, {"id": "272699", "name": "Caverna: The Forgotten Folk \u2013 Adventurers Promo"}, {"id": "248951", "name": "Caverna: The Forgotten Folk \u2013 Halflings promo"}, {"id": "183531", "name": "Caverna: Water Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 210, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 210, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 27552, "average": 8.02542, "bayesaverage": 7.85435, "stddev": 1.34862, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34643, "trading": 422, "wanting": 1750, "wishing": 10177, "numcomments": 4510, "numweights": 1426, "averageweight": 3.7847, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 28}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 25}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 444, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 154, "not_recommended_rating": 104}, "2": {"best_rating": 61, "recommended_rating": 237, "not_recommended_rating": 44}, "3": {"best_rating": 151, "recommended_rating": 200, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "4": {"best_rating": 235, "recommended_rating": 125, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "5": {"best_rating": 77, "recommended_rating": 176, "not_recommended_rating": 74}, "6": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 101, "not_recommended_rating": 179}, "7": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 51, "not_recommended_rating": 231}, "7+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 193}}}, "usersrated": 27552.0, "average": 8.02542, "bayesaverage": 7.85435, "stddev": 1.34862, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34643.0, "trading": 422.0, "wanting": 1750.0, "wishing": 10177.0, "numcomments": 4510.0, "numweights": 1426.0, "averageweight": 3.7847, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 28}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 25}], "game_family": "Caverna (Uwe Rosenberg)", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "104006", "name": "Village", "alternative_names": ["Descendance", "Het Dorp", "Kronika panstv\u00ed", "Pokolenia", "La Villa", "Village: Cronica genera\u021biilor", "Village: La Vita \u00e8 un Gioco", "Village: Nemzed\u00e9kek j\u00e1t\u00e9ka", "Village: \u039f \u039a\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0396\u03c9\u03ae\u03c2", "\u041b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c", "\u0421\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435", "\u6751\u306e\u4eba\u751f", "\u6751\u838a"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__thumb/img/5H-bOQSAtO8LaWI3i3_oG3CQHHg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2760568.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__original/img/XJ9DcBvOYgoSSNLjx0GP4If8hms=/0x0/pic2760568.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Village"], "categories": ["Farming", "Medieval"], "implementations": ["My Village"], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Area Majority / Influence", "Contracts", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement", "Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"], "designers": ["Inka Brand", "Markus Brand"], "artists": ["Dennis Lohausen"], "publishers": ["eggertspiele", "999 Games", "Albi", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Fantasmagoria", "Fire on Board Jogos", "Gigamic", "hobbity.eu", "Hobby Japan", "KADABRA", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Lautapelit.fi", "Ludicus", "Ludonova", "Pegasus Spiele", "Plan B Games", "Stronghold Games", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Tasty Minstrel Games", "uplay.it edizioni", "Zvezda"], "description": "Game description from the publisher:\n\nLife in the village is hard \u2013 but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please. One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.\n\nEach player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways.

Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.\n\nVillage is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.\n\nParaphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:\n\nEach player\u2019s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "293240", "name": "Super Power"}, {"id": "124118", "name": "Village: Customer Expansion"}, {"id": "166592", "name": "Village: Customer Expansion 2"}, {"id": "136223", "name": "Village: Inn"}, {"id": "155996", "name": "Village: Port"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 19948, "average": 7.52765, "bayesaverage": 7.36058, "stddev": 1.18774, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25935, "trading": 414, "wanting": 686, "wishing": 3646, "numcomments": 3273, "numweights": 1079, "averageweight": 3.0714, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 154}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 116}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 297, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 140}, "2": {"best_rating": 33, "recommended_rating": 171, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "3": {"best_rating": 83, "recommended_rating": 146, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 182, "recommended_rating": 62, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 105}}}, "usersrated": 19948.0, "average": 7.52765, "bayesaverage": 7.36058, "stddev": 1.18774, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25935.0, "trading": 414.0, "wanting": 686.0, "wishing": 3646.0, "numcomments": 3273.0, "numweights": 1079.0, "averageweight": 3.0714, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 154}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 116}], "game_family": "Village", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "104363", "name": "Rex: Final Days of an Empire", "alternative_names": ["Rex: Die letzten Tage eines Imperiums", "Rex: les Derniers Jours d'un Empire", "Rex: los \u00faltimos d\u00edas de un imperio", "Rex: \u00daltimos d\u00edas de un imperio", "Twilight Imperium Rex: Final Days of an Empire", "\u96f7\u514b\u65af: \u5e1d\u570b\u4e4b\u672b\u65e5"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HFhHL5g_mSWx-wOj9DaG7g__thumb/img/ozRX0wtjJ9ghZgTc6K2Mn-ltj2o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1246187.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HFhHL5g_mSWx-wOj9DaG7g__original/img/6W2kfKUK6XIVhcI8Vr61YTqB2ZE=/0x0/pic1246187.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Twilight Imperium"], "categories": ["Fighting", "Negotiation", "Political", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": ["Dune"], "mechanics": ["Alliances", "Area Majority / Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Force Commitment", "Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Bill Eberle", "John Goodenough", "Jack Kittredge", "Corey Konieczka", "Peter Olotka", "Christian T.

Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.\n\nIn Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.\n\nUnfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then \"spent\" to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.\n\nWhile the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.\n\nAlthough open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.\n\nAll this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 4190, "average": 7.09877, "bayesaverage": 6.64538, "stddev": 1.52954, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7227, "trading": 316, "wanting": 377, "wishing": 1846, "numcomments": 1035, "numweights": 252, "averageweight": 3.2698, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 780}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 185}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 473}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 108, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 68}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 73}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 75}, "4": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 58, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "5": {"best_rating": 25, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "6": {"best_rating": 90, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 46}}}, "usersrated": 4190.0, "average": 7.09877, "bayesaverage": 6.64538, "stddev": 1.52954, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7227.0, "trading": 316.0, "wanting": 377.0, "wishing": 1846.0, "numcomments": 1035.0, "numweights": 252.0, "averageweight": 3.2698, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 780}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 185}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 473}], "game_family": "Twilight Imperium", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "120217", "name": "City of Horror", "alternative_names": ["\u6bad\u5c4d\u57ce"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MzA7bgLA5NbeNO7m7RMF4Q__thumb/img/O3TJUaikZOCJ62KISsolMv8IYSk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1340620.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MzA7bgLA5NbeNO7m7RMF4Q__original/img/MAhZVijUcwO4iSwihF3NqYKhyuA=/0x0/pic1340620.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Horror", "Negotiation", "Zombies"], "implementations": ["Mall of Horror"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Voting"], "designers": ["Nicolas Normandon"], "artists": ["Miguel Coimbra"], "publishers": ["Repos Production", "Asmodee", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "City of Horror is a backstabbing survival-horror game.

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.\n\nForbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same \u2014 to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes \u2014 or they will do the same to you.\n\nEach round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:\n\n\n     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources\n     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities\n     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units\n     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.\n\n\nThe last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.\n\nBecause of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.

Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 7359, "average": 7.96916, "bayesaverage": 7.48565, "stddev": 1.44536, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11724, "trading": 254, "wanting": 710, "wishing": 3221, "numcomments": 1387, "numweights": 379, "averageweight": 3.8259, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 104}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 75}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 260, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 155}, "2": {"best_rating": 111, "recommended_rating": 96, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "3": {"best_rating": 123, "recommended_rating": 83, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4": {"best_rating": 65, "recommended_rating": 81, "not_recommended_rating": 63}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 132}}}, "usersrated": 7359.0, "average": 7.96916, "bayesaverage": 7.48565, "stddev": 1.44536, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11724.0, "trading": 254.0, "wanting": 710.0, "wishing": 3221.0, "numcomments": 1387.0, "numweights": 379.0, "averageweight": 3.8259, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 104}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 75}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "175324", "name": "Fog of Love", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q8impbJrOxmhzZbLTOnlZg__thumb/img/YOiFshgqroec7WqlRYRtwooq8zk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3726790.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q8impbJrOxmhzZbLTOnlZg__original/img/OyQXeAnPK2fohsIq-Pu0n-5HJeo=/0x0/pic3726790.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Contests: Fastaval Design Competition", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Fog of Love", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Theme: Love / Romance", "Theme: Queer / LGBTAIQ"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Hand Management", "Role Playing", "Simulation", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Storytelling"], "designers": ["Jacob Jaskov"], "artists": ["Cecilie Fossheim", "Mike H\u00f8jgaard", "Lotte M.

Its 11 lines move about 5 million passengers a day to 270 stations, along 400 km (250 mi) of track.\n\nThe massive network of London Underground stations makes up one of the most complex transportation systems in the world, and On the Underground challenges you to develop it. Build the most successful lines, connect them to landmarks, and attract passenger traffic!\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGameplay Overview\n\nIn On the Underground, the players build the Underground lines in London or the U-Bahn lines in Berlin. Each player controls 2-4 different lines, depending on the number of players.\n\nOn each turn, four destination cards are available, corresponding to stations on the map. You can take up to four actions; an action is either building track by placing one of your track tokens on the board or taking a branch token. A player may use two branch tokens to branch out of an existing line (whereas normally lines can be extended only at the endpoints).\n\nAfter each player's turn, a passenger token is moved along players' lines, avoiding walking as much as possible, to reach one or two destinations determined at the beginning of the turn. The destination cards corresponding to the visited stations are then replaced by new ones, then the next player takes their turn.\n\nPlayers score points in two ways:\n\n\n     By building track and connecting their lines to various types of stations, by building a circular line (in London), or at the end of the game if they have collected tiles from specific landmark stations (in Berlin).\n     By having the passenger use their lines when moving.\n\n\nAfter all destination cards have been drawn and all players have taken the same number of turns, the game ends.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDifferences from the First Edition of On the Underground\n\n\n     For their first turns only, the player first in turn order takes three actions, and the player last in turn order takes five actions. (Previously, everyone other than the start player had a few points added to their score as a balancing mechanism.)\n     The passenger is no longer removed from the board immediately when the draw deck is empty.\n     There is a new Berlin map, along with its corresponding cards and tiles.\n     On the London map, these single connections have been made double connections: Paddington-Shepherd's Bush, Shepherd's Bush-Goldhawk Road, Goldhawk Road-Hammersmith, Waterloo-Borough, London Bridge-Bank, Stratford-West Ham, and West Ham-Canning Town.\n     On the London map, this double connection has been made a triple connection: Borough-London Bridge\n     On the London map, the New Cross station has been removed, as has the connection between Aldgate and Canada Water.\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "326892", "name": "On the Underground: Street Fair"}, {"id": "284359", "name": "On the Underground: The Underground Challenge"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 657, "average": 7.41919, "bayesaverage": 6.08297, "stddev": 1.33291, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1523, "trading": 14, "wanting": 143, "wishing": 618, "numcomments": 185, "numweights": 16, "averageweight": 2.4375, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2049}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 931}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 19, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "2": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 10}}}, "usersrated": 657.0, "average": 7.41919, "bayesaverage": 6.08297, "stddev": 1.33291, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1523.0, "trading": 14.0, "wanting": 143.0, "wishing": 618.0, "numcomments": 185.0, "numweights": 16.0, "averageweight": 2.4375, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2049}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 931}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "281259", "name": "The Isle of Cats", "alternative_names": ["Die Insel der Katzen", "Isla de los gatos", "La Isla de los gatos", "La Isla de los Gatos", "L'\u00cele des Chats", "Macsk\u00e1k szigete", "Ostrov ko\u010dek", "\u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0456\u0432", "\u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043a", "\u8c93\u5cf6\u5947\u7de3 The Isle of Cats", "\uc57c\uc639\uc12c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AuAheDzhkLufiZFE9JaRNA__thumb/img/gENtMHYJDff6XaGGOYw9oSZShCs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4781085.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AuAheDzhkLufiZFE9JaRNA__original/img/qazXK8oO5dq94GCLRt99aKM4PF0=/0x0/pic4781085.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Cats", "Components: Meeples (Animal) / Animeeples", "Components: Polyominoes", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: The City of Kings", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Animals", "Fantasy", "Puzzle"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Drafting", "Grid Coverage", "Hidden Victory Points", "Pattern Building", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Square Grid", "Tile Placement", "Turn Order: Stat-Based"], "designers": ["Frank West"], "artists": ["Dragolisco", "Frank West"], "publishers": ["The City of Games", "GaGa Games", "Geekach Games", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Lucky Duck Games", "Maldito Games", "MINDOK", "Skellig Games", "sternenschimmermeer", "Yayoi The Dreamer"], "description": "The Isle of Cats is a competitive, medium-weight, card-drafting, polyomino cat-placement board game for 1-4 players (6 with expansions).\n\nYou are citizens of Squalls End on a rescue mission to The Isle of Cats and must rescue as many cats as possible before the evil Lord Vesh arrives.

It is a family-weight game for 2-4 players (5 with an expansion) that plays in 30-45 minutes.

Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.\n\nNo two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.\n\nA round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.\n\nAfter every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "315895", "name": "Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition \u2013 Prophecy of Kings"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 480, "minplaytime": 240, "maxplaytime": 480, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 12685, "average": 8.69462, "bayesaverage": 8.23882, "stddev": 1.5979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15806, "trading": 79, "wanting": 951, "wishing": 7680, "numcomments": 2013, "numweights": 586, "averageweight": 4.2235, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 5}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 3}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 4}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 297, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 214}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 210}, "3": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 134, "not_recommended_rating": 97}, "4": {"best_rating": 74, "recommended_rating": 145, "not_recommended_rating": 41}, "5": {"best_rating": 49, "recommended_rating": 175, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "6": {"best_rating": 215, "recommended_rating": 40, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 129}}}, "usersrated": 12685.0, "average": 8.69462, "bayesaverage": 8.23882, "stddev": 1.5979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15806.0, "trading": 79.0, "wanting": 951.0, "wishing": 7680.0, "numcomments": 2013.0, "numweights": 586.0, "averageweight": 4.2235, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 5}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 3}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 4}], "game_family": "Twilight Imperium", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "233312", "name": "Stuffed Fables", "alternative_names": ["F\u00e1bulas de Peluche", "Fiabe di Stoffa", "Der Herr der Tr\u00e4ume", "Der Herr der Tr\u00e4ume: Die Stoffi Chroniken", "Histoires de Peluches", "Pl\u00fcssmes\u00e9k", "Pluszowe Opowie\u015bci", "Ply\u0161ov\u00e1 hl\u00eddka", "\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0438", "\u73a9\u5076\u9a91\u58eb\u56e2"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CS83e1WOA5WMc4izRw6zwg__thumb/img/S8F7Wyt0tUKzok9xKx4-f4IegRE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3708878.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CS83e1WOA5WMc4izRw6zwg__original/img/_qm1FBu5oN7XcONKTjUR1fz7ja8=/0x0/pic3708878.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler", "Components: Book as Board", "Components: Miniatures", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Series: AdventureBook Games (Plaid Hat)"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Animals"], "implementations": ["Comanauts"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Role Playing", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Jerry Hawthorne"], "artists": ["Kendall Wilkerson", "Kristen Pauline", "Tregis"], "publishers": ["Plaid Hat Games", "Asmodee", "Asmodee Italia", "CrowD Games", "Cube Factory of Ideas", "Edge Entertainment", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "MINDOK", "Playfun Games", "Purple Meeple Games"], "description": "Stuffed Fables is an unusual adventure game in which players take on the roles of brave stuffies seeking to save the child they love from a scheming, evil mastermind. Make daring melee attacks, leap across conveyor belts, or even steer a racing wagon down a peril-filled hill. The game delivers a thrilling narrative driven by player choices. Players explore a world of wonder and danger, unlocking curious discoveries. The chapters of Stuffed Fables explore the many milestones of a child's life, creating a memorable tale ideal for families, as well as groups of adults who haven't forgotten their childlike sense of wonder.\n\nStuffed Fables is the first \"AdventureBook Game\", a new product line from Plaid Hat Games in which all of the action takes place in the unique storybook \u2014 a book that acts as your rules reference, story guide, and game board, all in one! Each adventure in the game takes place over several pages of the immersive AdventureBook. The book opens flat onto the table to reveal a colorful map or other illustration central to playing the game, with choices, story, and special rules on the opposite page.\n\nOn their turn, a player draws five dice from the bag. The colors of the dice drawn determine the types of actions and options available to the player. White dice can re-stuff stuffies injured in battle. Red dice perform melee attacks while green dice perform ranged attacks. Yellow dice search while blue dice are used for special actions and purple dice can be used as any color. Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks. Players can store dice for later, combine dice for stronger actions, or use them one-at-a-time for multiple activations. As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!\n\nPlayers can encourage each other by sharing dice or their precious stuffing. In addition to fighting minions, each page of the storybook offers numerous points of interest, charming characters to interact or trade with, as well as many unusual challenges. And each page is but one chapter that folds into a branching, overarching story with a multitude of items and a special discovery deck full of surprises.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "326199", "name": "Stuffed Fables: Oh, Brother!

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire\u2019s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.\n\nIn the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire\u2019s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.\n\nImperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You\u2019ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you\u2019ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.\n\nAs an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.\n\nWith these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "194901", "name": "Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Agent Blaise Villain Pack"},

Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.\n\nAfter two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 4, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 15, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 15, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 2364, "average": 7.29701, "bayesaverage": 6.59429, "stddev": 1.36491, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3657, "trading": 86, "wanting": 476, "wishing": 1803, "numcomments": 552, "numweights": 60, "averageweight": 1.4833, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 857}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 166}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 29}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 24, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "4": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 21}}}, "usersrated": 2364.0, "average": 7.29701, "bayesaverage": 6.59429, "stddev": 1.36491, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3657.0, "trading": 86.0, "wanting": 476.0, "wishing": 1803.0, "numcomments": 552.0, "numweights": 60.0, "averageweight": 1.4833, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 857}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 166}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 29}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "123096", "name": "Space Cadets", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YTPL0ZG_8Y4EQfiCXZzvrg__thumb/img/2gOYyhKR6WH8EuemztSCMQvqNbo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1362404.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YTPL0ZG_8Y4EQfiCXZzvrg__original/img/dHtDB2j1Qra9862RT452NKz1GUA=/0x0/pic1362404.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Space Cadets"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "Puzzle", "Real-time", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "implementations": ["Space Cadets: Dice Duel"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Flicking", "Grid Movement", "Memory", "Modular Board", "Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition", "Programmed Movement", "Push Your Luck", "Re-rolling and Locking", "Real-Time", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Geoff Engelstein", "Brian Engelstein", "Sydney Engelstein"], "artists": ["Karim Chakroun"], "publishers": ["Stronghold Games", "Asmodee"], "description": "It's your lifelong dream \u2013 to join the Star Patrol and be part of the crew of an interstellar Starship.

Enemy agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it's critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions.

As in the first two Pandemic Legacy games, each time you play brings new cards, rules, and conditions that affect future games. Each alias you create will gain contacts and other assets to execute your plans more smoothly. And, of course, the CIA will be watching and evaluating your performance in the field.

Monstrous invaders are gathering at the borders, aiming to invade and plunder the realm! Your king has chosen you to take charge of a province on the border; you will manage your province and help defend the realm. To accomplish this, you must influence the King's advisors and the Royal Family to obtain gold, wood, stones, and soldiers to expand and defend your lands. But you are not the only governor seeking the aid of the advisers! The other players also seek to collect the best resources for their own territories.\n\nKing Tritus is waiting for you. Will you be able to be the most influent and powerful governor of the realm?\n\nThe game of Kingsburg takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns. In every year, there are three production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops. Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army. Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.\n\nThe resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council.

Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors.

Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. VP goes only to the casino's owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents' casinos to make more money. Ultimately, though, only victory points matter, and that means making yourself boss of the biggest casinos.\n\nLords of Vegas contains: \n\n    Snazzy game board \n    4 turn summaries \n    55 cards \n    40 chips in 4 colors \n    48 dice in 4 colors \n    4 poker chips \n    Lots of money \n    45 casino blocks \n    Rules \n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "148572", "name": "Lords of Vegas: Mob Rules & Union of the Shakes"}, {"id": "130466", "name": "Lords of Vegas: Sky Bridge / Building Boom"}, {"id": "306445", "name": "Lords of Vegas: Underworld"}, {"id": "308068", "name": "Lords of Vegas: Underworld \u2013 Vegas Shutdown Promo Card"}, {"id": "151464", "name": "Lords of Vegas: UP!"}, {"id": "144851", "name": "Mayfair Game Variants & Mini-Expansions Set #1"}, {"id": "142993", "name": "Mayfair Game Variants & Mini-Expansions Set #2"}, {"id": "169757", "name": "Mayfair Games' Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #13"}, {"id": "151123", "name": "Mayfair Games' Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #7"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 6418, "average": 7.32922, "bayesaverage": 6.9688, "stddev": 1.3983, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8393, "trading": 130, "wanting": 679, "wishing": 2388, "numcomments": 1464, "numweights": 267, "averageweight": 2.3558, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 410}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 110}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 265}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 90, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "3": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 27}}}, "usersrated": 6418.0, "average": 7.32922, "bayesaverage": 6.9688, "stddev": 1.3983, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8393.0, "trading": 130.0, "wanting": 679.0, "wishing": 2388.0, "numcomments": 1464.0, "numweights": 267.0, "averageweight": 2.3558, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 410}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 110}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 265}], "game_family": "Lords of Vegas", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "12", "name": "Ra", "alternative_names": ["Reiner Knizia's Ra", "\u30e9\u30fc", "\u592a\u967d\u795e", "\ud0dc\uc591\uc2e0 \ub77c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1m3z3iX0iVtII8AEMuWOeA__thumb/img/qoWgC_i6XctwTIybaqZ8FldYCn0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3013552.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1m3z3iX0iVtII8AEMuWOeA__original/img/iA_LlRmPfFILGon-zvbWeEzxvX8=/0x0/pic3013552.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Egypt", "Game: Ra", "Mythology: Egyptian", "Series: Alea Big Box", "Series: Euro Classics (Reiner Knizia)"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Mythology"], "implementations": ["Priests of Ra", "Ra: The Dice Game", "Razzia!"], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Auction: Once Around", "Closed Economy Auction", "Constrained Bidding", "Push Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "artists": ["Allison Kline", "Franz Vohwinkel"], "publishers": ["alea", "Ravensburger", "25th Century Games", "999 Games", "ABACUSSPIELE", "DiceTree Games", "Edge Entertainment", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "New Games Order, LLC", "Precisamente", "Rio Grande Games", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "\u00dcberplay", "Windrider Games"], "description": "Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.\n\nStarting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris & Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This \"ziggurat expansion\", initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.\n\nSome versions of Tigris & Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u201310 in five different colors with three special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\n\nIn each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\n\nA turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.\n\nThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "583", "name": "The El Grande Expansions"}, {"id": "597", "name": "El Grande: Grandissimo"}, {"id": "3146", "name": "El Grande: Grossinquisitor und Kolonien"}, {"id": "370", "name": "El Grande: K\u00f6nig & Intrigant"}, {"id": "5754", "name": "El Grande: K\u00f6nig & Intrigant \u2013 Player's Edition"}, {"id": "27759", "name": "El Grande: K\u00f6nig & Intrigant \u2013 Unverk\u00e4ufliche Sonderkarten"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1995, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 23265, "average": 7.75853, "bayesaverage": 7.59546, "stddev": 1.33407, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22318, "trading": 379, "wanting": 1241, "wishing": 5163, "numcomments": 5212, "numweights": 2083, "averageweight": 3.0547, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 72}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 60}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 540, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 308}, "2": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 55, "not_recommended_rating": 345}, "3": {"best_rating": 22, "recommended_rating": 217, "not_recommended_rating": 179}, "4": {"best_rating": 174, "recommended_rating": 285, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "5": {"best_rating": 395, "recommended_rating": 94, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "5+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 212}}}, "usersrated": 23265.0, "average": 7.75853, "bayesaverage": 7.59546, "stddev": 1.33407, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22318.0, "trading": 379.0, "wanting": 1241.0, "wishing": 5163.0, "numcomments": 5212.0, "numweights": 2083.0, "averageweight": 3.0547, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 72}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 60}], "game_family": "El Grande", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "112", "name": "Condottiere", "alternative_names": ["\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0440", "\u0631\u06a9\u0628 (Rakab)", "\u50ad\u5175\u968a\u9577", "\u50ad\u5175\u968a\u9577\u65b0\u7248"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ez1nMA4g7Mx3BVBqZT9D2w__thumb/img/WbIDkxaZNX05TSmK-pqQYw1xv5A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4211268.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ez1nMA4g7Mx3BVBqZT9D2w__original/img/AaKHhx_TZr34DCLaWwj9C1daFmo=/0x0/pic4211268.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Country: Italy", "History: Italian City-States", "Series: Fantasy Flight Silver Line"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Medieval", "Negotiation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Constrained Bidding", "Hand Management"], "designers": ["Dominique Ehrhard", "Duccio Vitale", "Justin Kemppainen"], "artists": ["Dominique Ehrhard", "John Goodenough", "Serge Hochain", "Tomasz Jedruszek", "Mohammad Noureddine", "Scott Nicely", "David Palumbo", "Samuel Shimota"], "publishers": ["Eurogames", "Arclight", "Descartes Editeur", "Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "Lautapelit.fi", "Nexus Editrice", "Roomiz Games", "Ubik", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "It is 13th century Italy.

However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors. Enter the Condottiere. \n As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men. These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.\n\nThe object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid.  Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1995, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 8513, "average": 6.8306, "bayesaverage": 6.6054, "stddev": 1.32644, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10799, "trading": 331, "wanting": 329, "wishing": 1600, "numcomments": 2391, "numweights": 686, "averageweight": 1.9606, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 834}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 535}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 175, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 99}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 110}, "3": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 69, "not_recommended_rating": 48}, "4": {"best_rating": 82, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 84, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "6": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 67, "not_recommended_rating": 19}, "6+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 60}}}, "usersrated": 8513.0, "average": 6.8306, "bayesaverage": 6.6054, "stddev": 1.32644, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10799.0, "trading": 331.0, "wanting": 329.0, "wishing": 1600.0, "numcomments": 2391.0, "numweights": 686.0, "averageweight": 1.9606, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 834}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 535}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "118", "name": "Modern Art", "alternative_names": ["Art Moderne", "Arte Moderna", "\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e", "\u0647\u0646\u0631 \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0646", "\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30d7\u30b9 (Stamps)", "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u85dd\u8853 (\u73b0\u4ee3\u827a\u672f)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wLto-xaabHwKQe_Bc4iD1Q__thumb/img/AUqMholGVlwXLjMcxwiziE_7Ffw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3458036.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wLto-xaabHwKQe_Bc4iD1Q__original/img/V6gWtm8yHD-7A5F3mQshxGW1zuc=/0x0/pic3458036.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Theme: Art", "Theme: Painting / Paintings"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Economic"], "implementations": ["Modern Art Card Game"], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Auction: English", "Auction: Once Around", "Auction: Sealed Bid", "Auction: Turn Order Until Pass", "Commodity Speculation", "Hand Management"], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "artists": ["Carole Carrion", "Manuel Carvalho", "Chen Cheng-po", "Mike Doyle (I)", "Pete Fenlon", "Paul Laane", "Ramon Martins", "Daniel Melim", "Rafael Silveira", "Sigrid Thaler", "Zeilbeck & Natzeck Design Company"], "publishers": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "Arrakis Games", "CMON Limited", "DiceTree Games", "Drosselmeyer & Co.

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.\n\nPlayers start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.\n\nOn a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.\n\nThe expansion Citadels:  The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl\u00fcck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square).

Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.\n\nThere are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within \"range\" of your current gun.  The target player can play a \"MISSED!\" card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!\n\nInformation on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "20237", "name": "BANG!

The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.\n In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.\n Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.\n\nThrough the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1998, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated":

French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.\n\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: \"Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?\" or \"Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?\" Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.\n\nFirst game in the Carcassonne series.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeschreibung\n\nEine mittelalterliche Landschaft mit St\u00e4dten und Kl\u00f6stern, Stra\u00dfen und Wiesen. Mit Taktik und ihren Gefolgsleuten (Meeple) dehnen die Spieler in diesem raffinierten Legespiel ihren Einfluss auf die einzelnen Bereiche st\u00e4ndig aus. Und das mit wachsender Begeisterung!\nCarcassonne ist ein Legespiel, bei dem die Spieler verdeckt Landschaftspl\u00e4ttchen ziehen und an die bestehende Landschaft passend anlegen m\u00fcssen. Auf den Pl\u00e4ttchen sind St\u00e4dte, Stra\u00dfen, Kl\u00f6ster und Grasland in verschiedenen Kombinationen dargestellt. Wenn dann das Pl\u00e4ttchen passend angelegt wurde, darf der Spieler entscheiden, ob auf das gerade angelegte Pl\u00e4ttchen ein Meeple als Ritter (in Stadt), Wegelagerer (auf Stra\u00dfe), M\u00f6nch (in Kloster) oder Bauer (auf Wiese) eingesetzt werden soll, vor allem wenn es vielleicht gerade der letzte ist...\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "167903", "name": "20 Jahre Darmstadt Spielt"},

Each player starts with a basic deck of cards that they can use to purchase, or upgrade to, other, more powerful cards. Thunderstone Quest brings new play modes to the table. The game will tell a specific story with a series of pre-set dungeon tiles, monsters, heroes and support cards. Each will come with a series of mini-adventures and a story booklet that tells players what happens as they progress through the scenarios.\n\nOnce players have completed the quests they will be able to enjoy great replay value with the available selection of monsters, heroes, and support cards, as well as the new dungeon tiles, by choosing random set-ups before the start of play. Aside from heroes such as wizards, fighters, rogues, and clerics, cards will include supplies that heroes need like weapons, spells, items, or light to reach further into the dungeon.\n\nThe dungeon deck is created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different hero types, so players have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "295249", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: 4th Level Heroes"}, {"id": "247110", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: A Mirror in the Dark"}, {"id": "247113", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: At the Foundations of the World"}, {"id": "256610", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: Barricades Mode"}, {"id": "282349", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: Clockwork Destiny"}, {"id": "320379", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: Darkness Rising"}, {"id": "281458", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: Frozen in Time"}, {"id": "322781", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: Miricelle's Return"}, {"id": "247115", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: Ripples in Time"}, {"id": "247112", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: Risen from the Mire"}, {"id": "247114", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: Total Eclipse of the Sun"}, {"id": "282348", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: Vengeful Sands"}, {"id": "256611", "name": "Thunderstone Quest: What Lies Beneath"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 3023, "average": 7.93494, "bayesaverage": 7.06209, "stddev": 1.38221, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6594, "trading": 150, "wanting": 314, "wishing": 1786, "numcomments": 766, "numweights": 68, "averageweight": 2.7941, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 331}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 174}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 66, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "2": {"best_rating": 40, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 35, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 26, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 34}}}, "usersrated": 3023.0, "average": 7.93494, "bayesaverage": 7.06209, "stddev": 1.38221, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6594.0, "trading": 150.0, "wanting": 314.0, "wishing": 1786.0, "numcomments": 766.0, "numweights": 68.0, "averageweight": 2.7941, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 331}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 174}], "game_family": "Thunderstone", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 13, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "133528", "name": "City of Remnants", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tj5EDP1TSPnHoQFPhELP5g__thumb/img/9JKcu9BSwTww8aK8JrYgMDZVY-A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1470588.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tj5EDP1TSPnHoQFPhELP5g__original/img/xaiTUFwt3fmXVuwu9uwiSgnNrFo=/0x0/pic1470588.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Creatures: Aliens / Extraterrestrials", "Theme: Cyberpunk"], "categories": ["Dice", "Economic", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Territory Building"], "implementations": ["Neon Gods"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Majority / Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Colby Dauch", "Isaac Vega"], "artists": ["JJ Ariosa", "Peter Wocken"], "publishers": ["Plaid Hat Games"], "description": "Hot rain falls down upon a cold, rotting city.

Like your brothers and sisters, you will spend a huge part of your life preparing for your journey towards the Afterlife. Getting the support of loyal nobles and talented artisans, building a magnificent burial chamber, making offerings to the Gods\u2026 here are the main tasks set for you. But the gods are looking at you and you will have to do your best in order to satisfy their demands. Each of your actions will be judged during the weighing of your heart.\n\nPharaon is a game mixing resource management and worker placement into a single mechanism, thanks to its Wheel of Actions. It is located at the center of the gameboard, surrounded by 5 areas, representing the 5 actions featured in the game. Each round, the Wheel indicates which resource has to be spent for accessing the matching action. As the wheel rotates from one segment by the end of each of the 5 rounds, this access cost to actions fluctuates throughout the game. As a consequence, players have to plan their actions, anticipating which resources they may need for the next round. But there are a limited amount of available spots on the wheel, forcing you to watch your opponents, which resources they have, and what they may intend.\n\nHow to play ?\nA game of Pharaon is played in 5 rounds, during which the players take turns one after the other, until everyone has passed. On their turn, a player performs one of the 5 actions on the board. The actions can provide Prestige Points (PP), determining who wins at the end of the game, but they can also help getting new resources for further turns. To be allowed to perform an action, the player has to pay its Access cost, by spending the resource indicated by the Wheel of Actions for the area in which they want to act. They then pay the Action Cost by spending the corresponding resources. The resource spent on the Wheel to access this area gets deducted from the Action Cost, if it can match. So, it is useful to anticipate the rotation of the Wheel for taking the actions at their best cost. But there is a limit on how many times an action can be performed, and your opponents may need the same as you. Moreover, the game will be closely watched by the Gods. You will have to fulfill as many of their demands as possible to get their support and some extra PP.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished":

You can enter the opium den beneath the Bar of Gold, but beware, that may be Colonel Sebastian Moran lurking around the corner. You can capture the mystery and excitement of Holmes' London in this challenging and informative game. You, the player, will match your deductive abilities against your opponents and the master sleuth himself, Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, you are presented with a mystery to solve, and it is then up to you to trace the threads of evidence through the byways and mansions of nineteenth century London. You will interview suspects, search the newspapers for clues, and put together the facts to reach a solution.\n\nWhy were two lions murdered in Hyde Park? Who is responsible for the missing paintings from the National Gallery? Who murdered Oswald Mason and why? These are just a few of the cases that will challenge your ingenuity and deductive abilities.\n\nThis is not a board game: No dice, no luck, but a challenge to your mental ability.

It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.\n\nThe objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.\n\nHowever, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.\n\nAdditionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.\n\nPower Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "22355", "name": "Atolla Modulis (fan expansion for Funkenschlag)"}, {"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "95670", "name": "Funkenschlag: Speicherkraftwerk"}, {"id": "102696", "name": "Hoogspanning: Het Verre Oosten"}, {"id": "75259", "name": "Hoogspanning: Uitbreiding Benelux"}, {"id": "198280", "name": "Morphogea: A Modular Hex Map for Power Grid (fan expansion for Power Grid)"}, {"id": "69179", "name": "New Plants (fan expansion for Power Grid)"}, {"id": "147580", "name": "Power Grid: Australia & Indian Subcontinent"}, {"id": "25031", "name": "Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe"}, {"id": "88491", "name": "Power Grid: BGG Promo Card Set"}, {"id": "58708", "name": "Power Grid: Brazil/Spain & Portugal"}, {"id": "37397", "name": "Power Grid: China/Korea"}, {"id": "232004", "name": "Power Grid: Fabled Expansion"}, {"id": "38997", "name": "Power Grid: Flux Generator"}, {"id": "19319", "name": "Power Grid: France/Italy"}, {"id": "190505", "name": "Power Grid: High-Voltage DC Transmission Passage C"}, {"id": "285448", "name": "Power Grid: Middle East/South Africa"}, {"id": "131184", "name": "Power Grid: Northern Europe/United Kingdom & Ireland"}, {"id": "131458", "name": "Power Grid: Oracle & Industrial Espionage"}, {"id": "123122", "name": "Power Grid: Qu\u00e9bec/Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg"}, {"id": "78727", "name": "Power Grid: Russia & Japan"}, {"id": "108668", "name": "Power Grid: Supply Contract"}, {"id": "147932", "name": "Power Grid: Taxes"}, {"id": "29416", "name": "Power Grid: The New Power Plant Cards"}, {"id": "108667", "name": "Power Grid: The Robots"}, {"id": "181971", "name": "Power Grid: The Stock Companies"}, {"id": "111144", "name": "Power Grid: Theme Park"}, {"id": "55201", "name": "Power Grid: Transformer Station"}, {"id": "84462", "name": "Power Grid: Warehouse"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2004, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 55478, "average": 7.85968, "bayesaverage": 7.76118, "stddev": 1.33411, "median": 0.0, "owned": 65290, "trading": 932, "wanting": 1363, "wishing": 10007, "numcomments": 10247, "numweights": 4669, "averageweight": 3.2718, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 38}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 39}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1161, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 654}, "2": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 223, "not_recommended_rating": 629}, "3": {"best_rating": 110, "recommended_rating": 688, "not_recommended_rating": 148}, "4": {"best_rating": 727, "recommended_rating": 308, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "5": {"best_rating": 678, "recommended_rating": 297, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "6": {"best_rating": 195, "recommended_rating": 529, "not_recommended_rating": 163}, "6+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 468}}}, "usersrated": 55478.0, "average": 7.85968, "bayesaverage": 7.76118, "stddev": 1.33411, "median": 0.0, "owned": 65290.0, "trading": 932.0, "wanting": 1363.0, "wishing": 10007.0, "numcomments": 10247.0, "numweights": 4669.0, "averageweight": 3.2718, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 38}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 39}], "game_family": "Power Grid", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 29, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "2653", "name": "Survive: Escape from Atlantis!", "alternative_names": ["Atlantis", "The Island", "Ostrov", "Si salvi chi pu\u00f2!", "Survive!", "Survive!

In the 4 player game, players with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most buildings score decreasing numbers of points.\n\nOnly districts are scored in the first scoring round.\n\nIn the second scoring round at the end of the game, all land areas are scored, not just districts.\n\nThe player with the most points wins.\n\nMexica is the third game in the Mask Trilogy.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2002, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 4961, "average": 7.23782, "bayesaverage": 6.79886, "stddev": 1.17834, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8060, "trading": 242, "wanting": 419, "wishing": 1490, "numcomments": 1422, "numweights": 373, "averageweight": 2.6944, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 577}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 341}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 74, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 33}, "2": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "3": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 43, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 27}}}, "usersrated": 4961.0, "average": 7.23782, "bayesaverage": 6.79886, "stddev": 1.17834, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8060.0, "trading": 242.0, "wanting": 419.0, "wishing": 1490.0, "numcomments": 1422.0, "numweights": 373.0, "averageweight": 2.6944, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 577}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 341}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "260605", "name": "Camel Up (Second Edition)", "alternative_names": ["Camel Up: Edici\u00f3n 2.0", "Camel Up: Przebieg\u0142e Wielb\u0142\u0105dy", "Camel Up: Segunda Edi\u00e7\u00e3o", "\u99f1\u99dd\u5927\u8cfd"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pRZrHJNoPQ3gay9EkpuZLw__thumb/img/e3Kn0hIHVIvWAE9m8IF7icNxw4s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4304741.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pRZrHJNoPQ3gay9EkpuZLw__original/img/N2opocN_RQeuXDCZMSc4rjDDHJw=/0x0/pic4304741.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Camels", "Country: Egypt", "Game: Camel Up", "Theme: Deserts"], "categories": ["Animals", "Dice", "Racing"], "implementations": ["Camel Up"], "mechanics": ["Betting and Bluffing", "Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "designers": ["Steffen Bogen"], "artists": ["Chris Quilliams"], "publishers": ["Ediciones MasQueOca", "eggertspiele", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Lucrum Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "Piatnik", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Tower Tactic Games", "uplay.it edizioni"], "description": "In Camel Up, up to eight players bet on five racing camels, trying to suss out which ones will place first and second in a quick race around a pyramid.

In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.\n\nIn Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.\n\nPlayers use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.\n\nStone Age: 10th Anniversary is a new edition of the Stone Age base game that features a double-sided game board (winter and summer), decorative player pieces, a revised rulebook, two mini-expansions (\"The Igloos\" and \"The Wild Animals\"), and a \"Winter Is Hard!\" variant.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "107576", "name": "Stone Age: The Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 1318, "average": 8.0412, "bayesaverage": 6.63921, "stddev": 1.11673, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3334, "trading": 19, "wanting": 159, "wishing": 555, "numcomments": 243, "numweights": 35, "averageweight": 2.3429, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 16, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "3": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 6}}}, "usersrated": 1318.0, "average": 8.0412, "bayesaverage": 6.63921, "stddev": 1.11673, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3334.0, "trading": 19.0, "wanting": 159.0, "wishing": 555.0, "numcomments": 243.0, "numweights": 35.0, "averageweight": 2.3429, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "Stone Age", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "248125", "name": "Monumental", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A1NhQEEKNyavYgOzvdT-XQ__thumb/img/ruXlpSeZ-VPWXunGl4-kmlK4-ao=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4339963.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A1NhQEEKNyavYgOzvdT-XQ__original/img/1oH3vY0d2JXu9Na9LgdYmlODhDw=/0x0/pic4339963.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Mechanism: 4X", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Fighting", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Area Movement", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Matthew Dunstan"], "artists": ["Tey Bartolome", "Georges Bouchelaghem", "Hendry Iwanaga", "Agri Karuniawan", "Raph Lomotan", "Paul Mafayon", "Philippe Nouhra", "Andreas Rocha", "Brian Valeza"], "publishers": ["Funforge"], "description": "In Monumental, each player will control a civilization that will evolve through his city: a grid of 3x3 cards (coming out from the player's starting civilization deck) that can each be activated to gather various resources such as Science, Military, Production, Culture, and Gold that will allow them to trigger many actions. But there\u2019s a trick: one cannot activate all their cards at once, which means that tough choices will have to be made each turn in order to select the cards that are the most needed.\n\nThe resources gathered from the activated city cards will allow the players to acquire cards from a common pool, allowing them to get improved buildings, technologies, wonders, etc. and therefore to leverage their civilization deck to new heights through more and more efficient card combos. As the common pool of cards progresses (either as players have acquired cards or because they didn't - which leads to one card from the pool to be discarded per turn), the game progresses through eras. Medieval cards are better than classical cards, and industrial cards are even better, but of course those cards are more and more expensive to acquire.\n\nA modular board, at the center of the table, holds each civilization's army. The board is made of Provinces to be conquered. Unoccupied Province's inhabitants are barbarians who will provide resources to the player who defeats them. Holding a conquered province also brings victory points.\n\nThe player with the most impressive civilization at the end of the game will be remembered for all time (and they also win the game!).\n\n\u2014description based on the publisher's\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "311825", "name": "Monumental: African Empires"}, {"id": "266939", "name": "Monumental: The Lost Kingdoms"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2020, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 795, "average": 7.8978, "bayesaverage": 6.18602, "stddev": 1.49392, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1461, "trading": 21, "wanting": 188, "wishing": 945, "numcomments": 269, "numweights": 40, "averageweight": 2.725, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1715}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 47, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "2": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 22, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 29}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 31}}}, "usersrated": 795.0, "average": 7.8978, "bayesaverage": 6.18602, "stddev": 1.49392, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1461.0, "trading": 21.0, "wanting": 188.0, "wishing": 945.0, "numcomments": 269.0, "numweights": 40.0, "averageweight": 2.725, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1715}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "248167", "name": "Pandoria", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6AZ-2TlVB6AMsLJJ4Q2gEQ__thumb/img/DWQg87vfKPqYtAJnW1wBPkJKuJk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4280270.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6AZ-2TlVB6AMsLJJ4Q2gEQ__original/img/RUSQWkWXUVycE18edYBhhQDbs9U=/0x0/pic4280270.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Economic", "Fantasy", "Farming", "Territory Building"], "implementations": ["Pandoria Merchants"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Enclosure", "Hand Management", "Team-Based Game", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Jeffrey D.

The Elves, Mages, Dwarves, Halflings and Humans lived peacefully with each other, though they increasingly engaged in fierce competition for the prosperity and glory of their respective nations.\n\nAnd so it was that when the divisiveness threatened to break the thousand-year peace, the Goblin Hordes from across the sea unleashed a devastating surprise attack, and the peoples of the Hiddenlands could not unify quickly enough to repel them. Remnants of each of the realms fled by ship, until they at last discovered a new, unoccupied land upon which they could begin building their civilizations anew. The old rivalries would remain, of course, but perhaps this time, their competition with each other would not welcome disaster. It was a time of hope, a time for exploration and construction, and a time of renewed competition in a new world they called Pandoria.\n\nIn the \"gamer's game\" Pandoria, players discover this new land by placing tiles, and they claim its territory and resources by placing their people. When a type of terrain is completely surrounded by other terrain, every worker on the borders of that terrain gains its resources. Although more than one civilization will usually benefit, each player tries to gain more than the others. Mining gold gives you income to buy cards that have two options: buildings and spells. Acquiring wood allows you to build that side of the card for permanent advantages, while mining crystals gives you the power to use the card for its one-time spell instead. Excess resources can be converted into prestige Points, and some buildings can generate more. When the new land has been fully explored (all tiles have been placed), the player with the most prestige is declared the most powerful nation of Pandoria and wins the game!\n\nThe game includes a streamlined beginner game, as well as expanded rules for the complete game that includes asymmetrical player powers.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "282429", "name": "Pandoria: Artifacts"}, {"id": "269135", "name": "Pandoria: Extra Realms Tableaus"}, {"id": "285113", "name": "Pandoria: Realms"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 459, "average": 6.92971, "bayesaverage": 5.80134, "stddev": 1.33493, "median": 0.0, "owned": 742, "trading": 26, "wanting": 68, "wishing": 407, "numcomments": 137, "numweights": 21, "averageweight": 2.4286, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3610}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 24, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "2": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "3": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 5}}}, "usersrated": 459.0, "average": 6.92971, "bayesaverage": 5.80134, "stddev": 1.33493, "median": 0.0, "owned": 742.0, "trading": 26.0, "wanting": 68.0, "wishing": 407.0, "numcomments": 137.0, "numweights": 21.0, "averageweight": 2.4286, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3610}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "248490", "name": "Atlantis Rising (Second Edition)", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WRHngbJkWiKAJ4U8xSySIQ__thumb/img/kZ9kSXPe8naMaTtc9IV4SFOBCcw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4895878.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WRHngbJkWiKAJ4U8xSySIQ__original/img/L9MTX-jaDgKZ-0Ml8xZG4pHicWU=/0x0/pic4895878.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Mythology: Atlantis", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Civilization", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Mythology", "Prehistoric", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": ["Atlantis Rising"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Push Your Luck", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Galen Ciscell", "Brent Dickman"], "artists": ["Vincent Dutrait", "Peter Gifford"], "publishers": ["Elf Creek Games", "Ghenos Games", "Lucky Duck Games", "Skellig Games"], "description": "The isle of Atlantis, your home, is sinking.

Workers placed close to the shoreline are more rewarding, but are more likely to be flooded and the actions lost.\n\nEvery turn, each player draws a misfortune card that will flood certain locations along the ever-shrinking Atlantis shoreline, or may otherwise work to undermine your efforts to save your people. So you must race to gather the necessary resources to build and power the gate, before the island disappears beneath the waves forever.\n\nThis edition contains all new art and graphic design, created to bring even more attention to the thematic setting of the game. The Athenians Attack phase has been replaced with the Wrath of the Gods phase, requiring more strategic planning and adding to the sense of urgency. Now, instead of placing workers in an Atlantean Navy, players must cooperatively decide to flood a set number of tiles at the end of each round. To further aid them in their task, Councilor player powers have been expanded and made more impactful, and the knowledge deck has similarly been revised and expanded. The variable gate components, once built, no longer offer one-time bonuses, but create new worker placement spots where players can send Atlantean workers to unleash actions to help save their island.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "295017", "name": "Atlantis Rising (Second Edition): Extended Difficulty Mini-Expansion"}, {"id": "307302", "name": "Atlantis Rising: Medusa Unleashed"}, {"id": "321302", "name": "Atlantis Rising: Monstrosities"}, {"id": "326889", "name": "Atlantis Rising: Orator"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 1416, "average": 7.88591, "bayesaverage": 6.59527, "stddev": 1.30763, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2915, "trading": 26, "wanting": 489, "wishing": 2395, "numcomments": 442, "numweights": 43, "averageweight": 2.4186, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 856}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 427}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 157}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 41, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 19, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "7": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "7+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 12}}}, "usersrated": 1416.0, "average": 7.88591, "bayesaverage": 6.59527, "stddev": 1.30763, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2915.0, "trading": 26.0, "wanting": 489.0, "wishing": 2395.0, "numcomments": 442.0, "numweights": 43.0, "averageweight": 2.4186, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 856}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 427}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 157}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "156546", "name": "Monikers", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jBPKEKZmxcM3ipKNdDH7hQ__thumb/img/DiGMkjqqNsqEtb74hYAyE--6Zk8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5248164.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jBPKEKZmxcM3ipKNdDH7hQ__original/img/BooQ_H0Vv2KV8yi2om3q-fIX1ko=/0x0/pic5248164.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Traditional Games: Charades"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game", "Print & Play"], "implementations": ["Monikers"], "mechanics": ["Acting", "Card Drafting", "Role Playing", "Singing"], "designers": ["Alex Hague", "Justin Vickers"], "artists": ["C\u00e9cile Gari\u00e9py", "Alex Hague"], "publishers": ["CMYK", "Palm Court"], "description": "Monikers is a party game based on the public domain game Celebrity, where players take turns attempting to get their teammates to guess names by describing or imitating well-known people.\n\nIn the first round, clue givers can say anything they want, except for the name itself.

Blending Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology with a unique vision, it allows you to impact the game world in deep and meaningful ways. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike. Difficult decisions or harrowing choices wait behind every corner and seemingly minor tasks may reverberate with major long-term consequences.\n\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by con\u00ef\u00ac\u201aict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own. Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several con\u00ef\u00ac\u201aicting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to di\u00ef\u00ac\u20acerent deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\n\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need to brute force your way, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each con\u00ef\u00ac\u201aict fun and exciting, while keeping you immersed in the game.\n\nIn Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, the land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner. Many secrets can be discovered only after several games. Created by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has infusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "274797", "name": "Tainted Grail: Age of Legends"}, {"id": "297996", "name": "Tainted Grail: Forever Autumn Promo Cards"}, {"id": "308105", "name": "Tainted Grail: Past And Future Alternative Encounters Card Pack"}, {"id": "267325", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon \u2013 Echoes of the Past"}, {"id": "266659", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon \u2013 Niamh"}, {"id": "267408", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon \u2013 Red Death Expansion"}, {"id": "321718", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon \u2013 War Runes"}, {"id": "274795", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Last Knight"}, {"id": "324661", "name": "\ubd80\ud328\ud55c \uc131\ubc30: \ucd5c\ud6c4\uc758 \uae30\uc0ac\uc640 \uc804\uc124\uc758 \uc2dc\ub300"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 5140, "average": 8.46803, "bayesaverage": 7.55552, "stddev": 1.95389, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10283, "trading": 82, "wanting": 487, "wishing": 3672, "numcomments": 1548, "numweights": 245, "averageweight": 3.2776, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 85}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 16}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 284, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 153, "recommended_rating": 91, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "2": {"best_rating": 150, "recommended_rating": 87, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "3": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 106, "not_recommended_rating": 83}, "4": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 45, "not_recommended_rating": 162}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 182}}}, "usersrated": 5140.0, "average": 8.46803, "bayesaverage": 7.55552, "stddev": 1.95389, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10283.0, "trading": 82.0, "wanting": 487.0, "wishing": 3672.0, "numcomments": 1548.0, "numweights": 245.0, "averageweight": 3.2776, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 85}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 16}], "game_family": "Tainted Grail", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "101721", "name": "Mage Wars Arena", "alternative_names": ["Mage Wars", "Mage Wars: Das Duell der Magier", "\u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b \u041c\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432", "\u6cd5\u5e08\u6218\u4e89"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WxajTXKxDza3UvwNMs-PUA__thumb/img/ZHMk4Aqu_VTgP9IFwY5QriZL6W8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2386027.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WxajTXKxDza3UvwNMs-PUA__original/img/vPot4QMbaHIpmKiCCJCC8VxI-9E=/0x0/pic2386027.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Binders", "Components: Polyhedral (not D6) dice", "Game: Mage Wars", "Players: Two Player Only Games"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Deck Construction", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Line of Sight", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Turn Order: Progressive", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Bryan Pope", "Benjamin Pope"], "artists": ["Drew Baker", "Tiziano Baracchi", "Claire Beard", "Leonardo Borazio", "Jason Engle", "Mariusz Gandzel", "John Guytan", "Diego Gisbert Llorens", "Raven Mimura", "Jim Pavelec", "Roberto Pitturru", "R.

How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?\n\nMage Wars \u2014 redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy \u2014 pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts \u2013 all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!\n\nMage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called \"zones\", which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.\n\nEach player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells \u2013 such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments \u2013 are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.\n\nEvery Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:\n\n\n    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.\n    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.\n    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.\n    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.\n\n\nThe base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.\n\nNew Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game. The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!\n\nExtra copies of spells available with:\n\n    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1\n    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions":

Throughout the centuries of its existence, the Empire brought major advancements in engineering, architecture, science, art, and literature. By the beginning of the 5th Century, decades of political corruption, economic crisis, and an overburdened military had exacted a severe toll on the stability of the Empire. This paved the way for severe incursions from aggressive barbarian tribes, leading to a decline from which Rome would not recover. Now citizens, soldiers, and allies of Rome must unite to protect the Empire.\n\nCombining the cooperative gameplay of Pandemic with innovative new mechanisms, Pandemic: Fall of Rome takes players back in history to the time of the world's greatest empire: Rome. A weakened military has left the borders open to invasion from countless tribes such as the Anglo-Saxons, Goths, Vandals, and Huns. As you march through the Roman Empire, you must recruit armies, fortify cities, forge alliances, and face off against the invading hordes in battle.\n\nSimply defending Rome is not enough; players must find a way to stop the incursions and find peace with their neighboring peoples. Players collect sets of matching-colored cards to forge an alliance with the different tribes. In doing so, they gain the ability to use cards matching the tribe to convert other members of that tribe into Roman soldiers, furthering their ability to hold the line against other invaders.\n\nTake on unique roles with special abilities to improve your team's chances to protect against the invaders. Work together, use your skills wisely, and stop the fall of Rome!\n\nPandemic: Fall of Rome includes a solitaire mode in which the player takes on the burden of being the Emperor and commands three different roles to try to protect the city from the invading hordes. Players who want a more difficult game can try the \"Roma Caput Mundi\" challenge by adding more Revolt cards to the deck; they must also respect the law in Rome that Roman legions are not allowed in the city.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 3581, "average": 7.72923, "bayesaverage": 7.03029, "stddev": 1.14526, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6690, "trading": 73, "wanting": 396, "wishing": 1869, "numcomments": 655, "numweights": 78, "averageweight": 2.4615, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 355}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 207}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 63, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "2": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "3": {"best_rating": 31, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 28, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 28}}}, "usersrated": 3581.0, "average": 7.72923, "bayesaverage": 7.03029, "stddev": 1.14526, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6690.0, "trading": 73.0, "wanting": 396.0, "wishing": 1869.0, "numcomments": 655.0, "numweights": 78.0, "averageweight": 2.4615, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 355}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 207}], "game_family": "Pandemic", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "229599", "name": "Time Arena", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fs8XOxbVQLYneWJnj8JjSw__thumb/img/pPAFYa1YYCpid56ZHCEZi3s8Ayo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3685432.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fs8XOxbVQLYneWJnj8JjSw__original/img/z0yhfOZ3N00jCbpq7-JO509C3Ek=/0x0/pic3685432.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Digital Hybrid - App Required"], "categories": ["Fighting", "Real-time"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement"], "designers": ["Fabrice Lamouille"], "artists": ["ann&seb", "Shanshan Zhu"], "publishers": ["BLAM !"], "description": "Through incessant wars for its control, the Lords of Time put the source of immortality at risk.

This both ends their countdown and starts the opponent's.\n\nYou will also have to deal with another time factor since each of the characters forming your team has a specific recharge time.

As the dawn of the Aztecs comes closer, player efforts (and their ability to feed their workforce) are evaluated a total of three times. The player with the most fame is the winner.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "256951", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018"}, {"id": "264153", "name": "Teotihuacan: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018 Promo"}, {"id": "283302", "name": "Teotihuacan: City of Gods \u2013 Decoration Tiles"}, {"id": "315049", "name": "Teotihuacan: City of Gods \u2013 Increased Workforce"}, {"id": "279161", "name": "Teotihuacan: City of Gods \u2013 Man vs Meeple Promo"}, {"id": "301254", "name": "Teotihuacan: City of Gods \u2013 Promo Bundle"}, {"id": "279160", "name": "Teotihuacan: City of Gods \u2013 Pyramid Tile Promo, Red Temple"}, {"id": "262936", "name": "Teotihuacan: Dice Settlers Promo"}, {"id": "316777", "name": "Teotihuacan: Expansion Period"}, {"id": "270364", "name": "Teotihuacan: Late Preclassic Period"}, {"id": "293473", "name": "Teotihuacan: Shadow of Xitle"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 12147, "average": 7.95517, "bayesaverage": 7.64043, "stddev": 1.27724, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17011, "trading": 169, "wanting": 746, "wishing": 4606, "numcomments": 1829, "numweights": 551, "averageweight": 3.7677, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 60}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 49}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 232, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 83, "not_recommended_rating": 45}, "2": {"best_rating": 30, "recommended_rating": 125, "not_recommended_rating": 29}, "3": {"best_rating": 84, "recommended_rating": 93, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 110, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 82}}}, "usersrated": 12147.0, "average": 7.95517, "bayesaverage": 7.64043, "stddev": 1.27724, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17011.0, "trading": 169.0, "wanting": 746.0, "wishing": 4606.0, "numcomments": 1829.0, "numweights": 551.0, "averageweight": 3.7677, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 60}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 49}], "game_family": "Teotihuacan", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 11, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "134352", "name": "Two Rooms and a Boom", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jmf0M01DsReKLByori6OGg__thumb/img/L5WTzC1_QyuIddhi248RG5hYVvc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2335221.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jmf0M01DsReKLByori6OGg__original/img/59vCXZGUYwAeoe2nILFyiCmuDZA=/0x0/pic2335221.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Werewolf / Mafia", "Misc: No Table Needed"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction", "Negotiation", "Party Game", "Print & Play", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Acting", "Elapsed Real Time Ending", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "designers": ["Alan Gerding", "Sean McCoy"], "artists": ["Sean McCoy"], "publishers": ["Tuesday Knight Games"], "description": "In Two Rooms and a Boom \u2013 a social deduction/hidden role party game for six or more players \u2013 there are two teams: the Red Team and the Blue Team.

The fate of all existence is at stake. Is destruction inevitable, or are there ways to avoid ultimate cataclysm? The Norns, mystical beings of great power, have decided they will not go quietly into oblivion and have turned their attention to the well of Fate, Ur\u00f0r, in order to find any possible way to stop Ragnar\u00f6k. Looking deep into the swirling waters, they can foresee which potential combination of heroes, villains, battles, victories, and defeats might stop the end of all that is known \u2014 but will they find the right combination in time? Is there any true path to salvation at all? They must hurry and seek the true way through, before all is lost.\n\nIn God of War: The Card Game, players take on the role of the Norns as they try different combinations of heroes and events in order to stop Ragnar\u00f6k. Each game is a new attempt to find the right key to saving Midgard from destruction. Players must work together, embodying mighty heroes such as Kratos, Mimir, Atreus, Brok and Sindri, and Freya. They will fight enemies and bosses from the popular God of War video game, but combined and remixed in exciting new ways, creating unique \"What if...?\" scenarios each time they play. If they succeed, the way forward has been secured and Ragnar\u00f6k can be halted. Failure means the Norns will have to try again as only death and destruction lay along that particular path.\n\nEach quest in God of War: The Card Game is made up of a mosaic of cards that recreate monsters and locations from the video game. Each quest's mosaic is different, and each card is double-sided, depending on whether a section has been destroyed or not, and each has special rules that go into effect when it is face up on the tabletop. Learning how each quest is won, as well as what strategy to employ, is key to victory.\n\nAs players progress, earlier quests have an effect on what comes after them. At certain points along their path, players must choose which quest they will complete. Completing one might grant a bonus, but quests left untouched result in dire permanent consequences as the players move forward. These choices and challenges lead to new strategies, making it so no two games of God of War: The Card Game are alike.\n\nHeroes in the game have several elements that make them unique. Each comes with their own dashboard that explains their special abilities and health totals, in addition to tracking the number of cards a player can keep in their hand from round to round. Tokens are used to keep everything clear as heroes gain and lose health and build up their power so they can unleash a mighty special attack. Heroes begin the game with a unique starting deck of cards that will be augmented from additional decks as the game progresses. Players can construct their deck to focus on their strengths or look for ways to generalize their approach, preparing for future quests that lie ahead. Each hero also has a unique standee that indicates which portion of the mosaic they are facing. With multiple heroes from which to choose, numerous ways to build their deck, and various different quests to attempt, each game of God of War: The Card Game will be a new experience that will echo throughout eternity.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "286195", "name": "God of War: The Card Game \u2013 Boy!"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 357, "average": 6.97892, "bayesaverage": 5.73659, "stddev": 1.60437, "median": 0.0, "owned": 918, "trading": 19, "wanting": 44, "wishing": 283, "numcomments": 99, "numweights": 9, "averageweight": 2.7778, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4269}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 10, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 3}}}, "usersrated": 357.0, "average": 6.97892, "bayesaverage": 5.73659, "stddev": 1.60437, "median": 0.0, "owned": 918.0, "trading": 19.0, "wanting": 44.0, "wishing": 283.0, "numcomments": 99.0, "numweights": 9.0, "averageweight": 2.7778, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4269}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "201846", "name": "Expancity", "alternative_names": ["\uc775\uc2a4\ud32c\uc2dc\ud2f0"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e_JVc5oTeZyV2yT-KytG7Q__thumb/img/xTW_PDN5A84bhQVNZJiwOSC5ZC0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4129126.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e_JVc5oTeZyV2yT-KytG7Q__original/img/__ISOQG6KpUYMLJYrEhYytlqOCI=/0x0/pic4129126.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["City Building", "Economic"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Modular Board", "Simulation", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Alex Cutler"], "artists": ["Coen Pohl"], "publishers": ["Breaking Games", "CMON Limited", "Happy Baobab"], "description": "Expancity is a city-building game in which players both collaborate and compete to build a thriving metropolis block by block!\n\nLay down residential and commercial tiles, then claim them with your stackable building blocks to break ground on towers that will rise high above the playing field.

One player controls the Overseer, controlling the monsters of the catacombs; the other player(s) control the four heroes who cooperatively try to defeat the monsters and eventually the Catacomb Lord. Each of the heroes has special abilities that must also be used effectively if they are to prevail.\n\nThe main mechanism of Catacombs is for the players to flick wooden discs representing the monsters and the heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb.

As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\n\nWith the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.\n\nThe Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.\n\nPlayers have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.\n\nThe Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.\n\nThe miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.\n\nAction Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.\n\nOnce a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.\n\nThe round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.\n\nOnce the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "204573", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016"}, {"id": "91072", "name": "Saboteur 2 (expansion-only editions)"}, {"id": "213290", "name": "Saboteur: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016 Promo"}, {"id": "281313", "name": "Saboteur: Cancellation"}, {"id": "290696", "name": "Saboteur: Das Stollenfest"}, {"id": "279956", "name": "Saboteur: Inventory"}, {"id": "227424", "name": "Saboteur: Map Swap"}, {"id": "158605", "name": "Saboteur: Rock Gold"}, {"id": "201027", "name": "Saboteur: Selfish Dwarf"}, {"id": "233013", "name": "Saboteur: The Wardrobe Cavern"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2004, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 10, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 24999, "average": 6.5785, "bayesaverage": 6.46516, "stddev": 1.2856, "median": 0.0, "owned": 39462, "trading": 741, "wanting": 210, "wishing": 1796, "numcomments": 4573, "numweights": 1441, "averageweight": 1.3282, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1058}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 113}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 338}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 309, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 212}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 212}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 195}, "4": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 99, "not_recommended_rating": 140}, "5": {"best_rating": 57, "recommended_rating": 178, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "6": {"best_rating": 110, "recommended_rating": 130, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "7": {"best_rating": 167, "recommended_rating": 78, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "8": {"best_rating": 139, "recommended_rating": 81, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "9": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 118, "not_recommended_rating": 29}, "10": {"best_rating": 49, "recommended_rating": 120, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "10+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 123}}}, "usersrated": 24999.0, "average": 6.5785, "bayesaverage": 6.46516, "stddev": 1.2856, "median": 0.0, "owned": 39462.0, "trading": 741.0, "wanting": 210.0, "wishing": 1796.0, "numcomments": 4573.0, "numweights": 1441.0, "averageweight": 1.3282, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1058}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 113}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 338}], "game_family": "Saboteur", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "7", "num_expansions": 10, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "136991", "name": "Loony Quest", "alternative_names": ["Firkaland", "Szalona Misja", "\u602a\u7269\u4ed9\u5883"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iIIGoA267xJDn3RuOfXBeQ__thumb/img/zX7ii2eBry5znNIWJ7-Fisqttbw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3043308.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iIIGoA267xJDn3RuOfXBeQ__original/img/abp_2EVOj6Sl2B54Xi9JC73Ij64=/0x0/pic3043308.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Loony Quest"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "Fantasy", "Real-time"], "implementations": ["Doodle Quest"], "mechanics": ["Line Drawing"], "designers": ["Laurent Escoffier", "David Franck"], "artists": ["Mathieu Leyssenne", "Paul Mafayon"], "publishers": ["Libellud", "Br\u00e4dspel.se", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "In the wonderful land of Arkadia, a very old king has no heir.

All of the forum posts, and linked items are being moved to the individual game entries, with anything sufficiently generic being linked to the Summoner Wars Master Set. All content will be maintained.\n\nSummoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game.  Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.  These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens.   But most notoriously, they summon their great race\u2019s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.  A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.\n\nEach Starter Set of Summoner Wars contains 2 complete, battle-ready Factions, ready to jump you and an opponent into the thick of the War for Itharia.  Each Faction is a unique race or civilization with its own secret goals, be it wild-eyed Elves bent on revenge, or blood-crazed Goblins who merely want to set the world ablaze.  Starter Sets also include everything you will need to play, including a Battle Mat, Wound counters, dice, and a rulebook.\n\nBut the war doesn\u2019t end there!  Summoner Wars is fully expandable with entirely new faction decks such as the hideous Undead of the Fallen Kingdom, or the righteous and knightly Human Vanguards.  In addition, each Faction will have its own expansions, adding new warriors, summoners, and abilities to allow for a never-ending mix of combat options and surprises.  Expansions will also include Mercenary units - warriors who care nothing for politics and will fight for any side that can afford them!\n\nSummoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games.  By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing.  During the game, players summon and move their various warriors about the battlefield using their unique powers and abilities to wreak havoc on the enemy lines.  In the course of a game each side will inflict terrible casualties upon the other in their brutal quest for victory.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "126942", "name": "Summoner Wars: Bellor's Retribution

of the Robo Rally automobile factory who work long, hard days at the assembly line building high\u00e2\u20ac\u0090speed supercars, but never get to see them in action. On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!\n\nEnter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.\n\nThe 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:\n\n\n    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says \"Again\" and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says \"Energy\" and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.\n\n\n\n     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.\n\n\n\n    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. \"Normal\" damage from the board or a robot laser gives you \"spam\" damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.\n\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 2189, "average": 7.07794, "bayesaverage": 6.37568, "stddev": 1.47713, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4630, "trading": 84, "wanting": 132, "wishing": 825, "numcomments": 434, "numweights": 35, "averageweight": 2.2857, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1238}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 703}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 28, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 21}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 14}}}, "usersrated": 2189.0, "average": 7.07794, "bayesaverage": 6.37568, "stddev": 1.47713, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4630.0, "trading": 84.0, "wanting": 132.0, "wishing": 825.0, "numcomments": 434.0, "numweights": 35.0, "averageweight": 2.2857, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1238}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 703}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "238393", "name": "Monolith Arena", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mfw6D4q2vBk13OEKmdCQZA__thumb/img/yhiueQTzEYPXCoX8Dgf23AZmTxU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4305058.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mfw6D4q2vBk13OEKmdCQZA__original/img/DAuPpNxMCzIfwp6pEMfk0OuIyE0=/0x0/pic4305058.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Fighting"], "implementations": ["Neuroshima Hex! 3.0"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Hexagon Grid", "Player Elimination", "Team-Based Game", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Micha\u0142 Oracz"], "artists": ["Jakub Fajtanowski", "Ewa Kostorz", "Aleksandar Mihajlovic", "Nakarin Sukontakorn", "Rafa\u0142 Szyma"], "publishers": ["Portal Games", "IELLO", "Maldito Games", "Pegasus Spiele"], "description": "Wage war against opponents on a hexagonal board.

They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the \u2018Imascheren\u2019 (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.\n\nThe game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.\n\nThe display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).\n\nThe winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "189661", "name": "Targi: The Action Tokens"}, {"id": "202453", "name": "Targi: The Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 13750, "average": 7.64588, "bayesaverage": 7.41956, "stddev": 1.0924, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21325, "trading": 205, "wanting": 891, "wishing": 4361, "numcomments": 2383, "numweights": 475, "averageweight": 2.3453, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 122}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 94}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 128, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 83}, "2": {"best_rating": 120, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 88}}}, "usersrated": 13750.0, "average": 7.64588, "bayesaverage": 7.41956, "stddev": 1.0924, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21325.0, "trading": 205.0, "wanting": 891.0, "wishing": 4361.0, "numcomments": 2383.0, "numweights": 475.0, "averageweight": 2.3453, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 122}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 94}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "247763", "name": "Underwater Cities", "alternative_names": ["Cidades submersas", "Podmo\u0159sk\u00e1 m\u011bsta", "Podwodne Miasta", "V\u00edz alatti v\u00e1rosok", "\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30ba", "\u6c34\u4e0b\u57ce\u5e02 Underwater Cities", "\uc5b8\ub354\uc6cc\ud130 \uc2dc\ud2f0\uc988"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__thumb/img/1gGYiRBx7W4wyLy826EHGTdjsKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4837710.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__original/img/LCsuq0PJ4JEVyrV5YSaLqaIkGv0=/0x0/pic4837710.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Under the Sea"], "categories": ["Card Game", "City Building", "Civilization", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Nautical", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["End Game Bonuses", "Hand Management", "Income", "Network and Route Building", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Turn Order: Stat-Based", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Vladim\u00edr Such\u00fd"], "artists": ["Uildrim", "Milan Vavro\u0148"], "publishers": ["Delicious Games", "Arrakis Games", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hobby World", "MeepleBR", "MINDOK", "MS Edizioni", "MYBG Co., Ltd.", "Portal Games", "Rio Grande Games", "sternenschimmermeer", "\u6570\u5bc4\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Suki Games)"], "description": "In Underwater Cities, which takes about 30-45 minutes per player, players represent the most powerful brains in the world, brains nominated due to the overpopulation of Earth to establish the best and most livable underwater areas possible.\n\nThe main principle of the game is card placement.

Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Overlord, playing the opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.\n\nEach game is a scenario, played on a map. There are 4 maps included in the retail copy of the game, and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There are 9 scenarios in the base box.\n\nAt the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Overlord gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, and cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.\n\nDuring their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend \"gems\" from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their \"spent\" pool box to their \"available\" pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.\n\nThe Overlord plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Overlord has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Overlord chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Overlord can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).\n\nIn a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Overlord wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective \u2014 but in some scenarios, the Overlord has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "248345", "name": "Compendium: The Overlord \u2013 Tome I (fan expansion for Conan)"}, {"id": "248346", "name": "Compendium: The Overlord \u2013 Tome II (fan expansion for Conan)"}, {"id": "213514", "name": "Conan: Baal-pteor"}, {"id": "213515", "name": "Conan: Black Dragons"}, {"id": "238078", "name": "Conan: Book of Set"}, {"id": "214541", "name": "Conan: Brom Guest Box"}, {"id": "212245", "name": "Conan: Collectors Box"}, {"id": "213508", "name": "Conan: Crossbowmen"}, {"id": "213519", "name": "Conan: Demon of the Earth"}, {"id": "214540", "name": "Conan: Dragon"}, {"id": "213518", "name": "Conan: Giant Wolves"}, {"id": "172170", "name": "Conan: Khitai"}, {"id": "213505", "name": "Conan: Kushite Witch Hunters"}, {"id": "173566", "name": "Conan: Nordheim"}, {"id": "212630", "name": "Conan: Paolo Parente Guest box"}, {"id": "213517", "name": "Conan: Sabertooth Tiger"}, {"id": "172784", "name": "Conan: Stygia"}, {"id": "302263", "name": "Conan: Tales of the Red Brotherhood"}, {"id": "213516", "name": "Conan: The Black Ones"}, {"id": "302261", "name": "Conan: The Conqueror"}, {"id": "303371", "name": "Conan: The Hidden Chambers"}, {"id": "231406", "name": "Conan: The Legend of the Devil in Iron"}, {"id": "266470", "name": "Conan: The Monolith Sourcebook"}, {"id": "303370", "name": "Conan: The Shadow Kingdom"}, {"id": "302262", "name": "Conan: Tome of Skelos"}, {"id": "213504", "name": "Conan: Vanir Valkyrie"}, {"id": "214545", "name": "Conan: Xavier Collette Guest Box"}, {"id": "213841", "name": "Conan: Yogah of Yag"}, {"id": "218878", "name": "Corinthia: A Conan / Mythic Battles \u2013 Pantheon Crossover"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 3893, "average": 7.71376, "bayesaverage": 6.9339, "stddev": 1.55298, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7840, "trading": 210, "wanting": 250, "wishing": 1575, "numcomments": 995, "numweights": 103, "averageweight": 2.767, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 444}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 88}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 69, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "2": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 28, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "3": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "4": {"best_rating": 35, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "5": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 26, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "5+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 25}}}, "usersrated": 3893.0, "average": 7.71376, "bayesaverage": 6.9339, "stddev": 1.55298, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7840.0, "trading": 210.0, "wanting": 250.0, "wishing": 1575.0, "numcomments": 995.0, "numweights": 103.0, "averageweight": 2.767, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 444}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 88}], "game_family": "Conan (Monolith)", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 29, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "142296", "name": "Funemployed", "alternative_names": ["Funemployed!", "Funemployed: 'Hiring Frenzy'"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o-fsLzEaCHcoAv3oxzOI_w__thumb/img/c40hqqP80E7K0mg7ysCBeW7K7gA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3558503.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o-fsLzEaCHcoAv3oxzOI_w__original/img/5wTG0KZDB7OcbFhlx7zzTxKUdZ4=/0x0/pic3558503.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Educational", "Humor", "Party Game", "Word Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Acting", "Card Drafting", "Player Judge", "Role Playing", "Storytelling"], "designers": ["Anthony Conta"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["IronWall Games", "Mattel", "Urban Island Games, LLC"], "description": "Funemployed is a card-based party game in which everyone's trying to become employed.

In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.\n\nThis is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.\n\nEach turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player\u2019s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "310777", "name": "Gloomhaven: Beyond the End of the World (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "312638", "name": "Gloomhaven: Curse of the Lost Cabal (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "312632", "name": "Gloomhaven: Dice Tower 2020 Kickstarter (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "250337", "name": "Gloomhaven: Forgotten Circles"}, {"id": "312635", "name": "Gloomhaven: No Pun Included 2019 Kickstarter (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "298195", "name": "Gloomhaven: Return of the Lost Cabal (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "297586", "name": "Gloomhaven: Secrets of the Lost Cabal (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "226868", "name": "Gloomhaven: Solo Scenarios"}, {"id": "310773", "name": "Gloomhaven: The Catacombs of Chaos (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "231934", "name": "Gloomhaven: The End of the World (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "300402", "name": "Gloomhaven: The Lucky Meeple (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "310754", "name": "Gloomhaven: The Tower of Misfortune (Promo Scenario)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 39911, "average": 8.8033, "bayesaverage": 8.55921, "stddev": 1.61003, "median": 0.0, "owned": 64709, "trading": 435, "wanting": 1402, "wishing": 15636, "numcomments": 7384, "numweights": 1730, "averageweight": 3.8538, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1058, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 110, "recommended_rating": 453, "not_recommended_rating": 233}, "2": {"best_rating": 241, "recommended_rating": 593, "not_recommended_rating": 59}, "3": {"best_rating": 511, "recommended_rating": 352, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "4": {"best_rating": 334, "recommended_rating": 411, "not_recommended_rating": 111}, "4+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 576}}}, "usersrated": 39911.0, "average": 8.8033, "bayesaverage": 8.55921, "stddev": 1.61003, "median": 0.0, "owned": 64709.0, "trading": 435.0, "wanting": 1402.0, "wishing": 15636.0, "numcomments": 7384.0, "numweights": 1730.0, "averageweight": 3.8538, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1}], "game_family": "Gloomhaven", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 12, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "91536", "name": "Quarriors!", "alternative_names": ["Quarriors", "Quarriors!

They must conjure the mysterious powers of Quiddity, cast powerful spells, and summon their creatures to battle if they hope to overcome rivals and earn their rightful place as the Champion!\n\nQuarriors has the frenetic excitement of a dice battle game, with an added \u2018deckbuilding\u2019 twist: players customize their dice pools during the game using resources generated by their rolls.\n\nQuarriors takes the best of deckbuilding games without the tedium of shuffling.  Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you\u2019re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.\n\nAlternate Description of Quarriors\n\nIn Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form \"the Wilds\" in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.\n\nQuarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "133565", "name": "Quarriors!

In the winter of 1848 a man building a sawmill on the South Fork of the American River spotted some bright nuggets in the tailrace waters below. Sure enough, it was gold! Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, word spread quickly and it triggered the California Gold Rush of \u201849.\n\nThousands of people arrived from far and wide, making Coloma one of the fastest growing boomtowns in the country. Claims were staked, camps and makeshift homes were built, and hotels and saloons sprung up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their cut of the land\u2019s wealth. For many it was Coloma or Bust!\n\nIn the game of Coloma, you are a pioneer who has recently traveled out West to strike it rich and make a name for yourself. You will prospect for gold and use your windfalls to recruit workers, rustle up horses, and establish businesses. You will also get opportunities to explore the surrounding riverways and frontier lands. But alas! You are not alone\u2014every other pioneer seems to have gotten the same idea! Therefore, it will take extra cunning tactics on your part to not go Bust with the rest of them\u2026\n\nOverview of Play\nAt the beginning of each chapter, you and the other players will simultaneously select an action to perform on the board. Once your selections are revealed, you must check if a majority of players chose the same action. If so, it is a Bust\u2014which disables the Boom bonus that would be included otherwise. Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons on the map, building bridges and businesses, and placing camps and gunmen. After that, a section of the board is rotated\u2014slightly changing the layout of the actions for the upcoming chapter.\n\nWhen the rotating section hits high noon, the round ends with a bang: a shootout against an ever-growing number of outlaws! If you and the other players can outnumber the outlaws with your combined gunmen, you will get your fair share of the rewards. But if not, the rewards drop, and some of the gunmen will go to the graveyard... The game ends after the third shootout, and the player with the most points wins!\n\nColoma is a fast moving game with many paths to victory. It offers unique twists on simultaneous action selection, resource management, and engine-building. The town cards in your tableau allow you to play more efficiently, gain extra actions, and bend the rules to your advantage. With these cards and the bridge tiles (which add points based on what you achieve), you can create the perfect combination for your strategy and play style.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "277296", "name": "Coloma: Buster Promo Card"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 1183, "average": 7.44703, "bayesaverage": 6.34646, "stddev": 1.2047, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1907, "trading": 26, "wanting": 254, "wishing": 1055, "numcomments": 273, "numweights": 52, "averageweight": 2.9423, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1295}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 634}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 33, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "6": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 10}}}, "usersrated": 1183.0, "average": 7.44703, "bayesaverage": 6.34646, "stddev": 1.2047, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1907.0, "trading": 26.0, "wanting": 254.0, "wishing": 1055.0, "numcomments": 273.0, "numweights": 52.0, "averageweight": 2.9423, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1295}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 634}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "231819", "name": "Sonar", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GJIebwr7f57nohwY6idxDg__thumb/img/8zwRcb13GAEmTY-WBkVu7QMDu0Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3662558.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GJIebwr7f57nohwY6idxDg__original/img/MrjcMSxDavb9b0xsEASqYOUIQ64=/0x0/pic3662558.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Captain Sonar", "Theme: Submarines"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Fighting", "Nautical"], "implementations": ["Sonar Family", "Captain Sonar"], "mechanics": ["Line Drawing", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": ["Roberto Fraga", "Yohan Lemonnier"], "artists": ["Xavier Gueniffey Durin", "Ervin", "Sabrina Tobal"], "publishers": ["FoxGames", "Matagot"], "description": "Time for an underwater game of cat-and-mouse, with each of the two teams in Sonar competing to be the first to deal two points of damage to the other.

A team can be one or two players, and with two players on a team, each player takes a different role: Captain or Radio Operator. (A one-person team handles both roles.) A divider separates the teams, and each Captain marks their starting location on the map.\n\nOn a turn, the Captain calls out an action, typically moving their sub one space north, south, east, or west. When they do this, they call out a direction, mark their new location, and add one energy to their ship's register. The Radio Operator on the other team notes the movement of this sub on a plastic sheet, and through deduction and trial-and-error tries to determine exactly where the opposing sub might be on the map.\n\nInstead of a moving, a Captain can also:\n\n\n    Use sonar: Erase two energy from your register; the opposing team must reveal their row or column.\n    Go silent: Erase three energy from your register; move your sub, but don't gain energy and don't tell the opponents which direction you're moving.\n    Fire a torpedo: Erase four energy from your register; call out coordinates in your quadrant (e.g., F6); if the opponents are on that space, they take a point of damage.\n    Surface: Announce your location to the opposing team, then erase your previous path on your map; you can't cross your own path during the game, so sometimes you need to surface in order not to box yourself in.\n\n\nYou can have at most four energy in reserve, so you need to manage movement and the other actions carefully so that you'll be able to fire at the opponents once you know where they are \u2014 ideally without being torpedoed in response!\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 1036, "average": 6.76354, "bayesaverage": 6.01364, "stddev": 1.20479, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3366, "trading": 262, "wanting": 47, "wishing": 342, "numcomments": 250, "numweights": 18, "averageweight": 1.8889, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2333}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 10, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 6}}}, "usersrated": 1036.0, "average": 6.76354, "bayesaverage": 6.01364, "stddev": 1.20479, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3366.0, "trading": 262.0, "wanting": 47.0, "wishing": 342.0, "numcomments": 250.0, "numweights": 18.0, "averageweight": 1.8889, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2333}], "game_family": "Captain Sonar", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "108745", "name": "Seasons", "alternative_names": ["\u00c9vszakok", "Pory Roku", "\u0421\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u044b", "\u5341\u4e8c\u5b63\u7bc0\u306e\u9b54\u6cd5\u4f7f\u3044", "\u56db\u5b63\u7269\u8a9e", "\uc2dc\uc98c\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/awmZ9rYy-hTgea6Vdp_OoQ__thumb/img/OBVCWq284XUhX2sKlMwoilFfuGk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1299390.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/awmZ9rYy-hTgea6Vdp_OoQ__original/img/KIQ10GbCcfxPNQKUOMWEMVKA9Ao=/0x0/pic1299390.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Dice with Icons", "Game: Seasons", "Mechanism: Dice Drafting", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Setting: Kingdom of Xidit"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Fantasy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Take That", "Victory Points as a Resource"], "designers": ["R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e"], "artists": ["R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e", "Xavier Gueniffey Durin", "St\u00e9phane Gantiez"], "publishers": ["Libellud", "Asmodee", "Asmodee Italia", "Asterion Press", "CrowD Games", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hobby Japan", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "sternenschimmermeer", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "The greatest sorcerers of the kingdom have gathered at the heart of the Argos forest, where the legendary tournament of the 12 seasons is taking place. At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!\n\nSeasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:\n\nThe first phase \"Prelude\" consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.\n\nOnce the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.\n\nNext comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).\n\nThese cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: \n- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) \n- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards\n- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. \n- Draw new cards\n\nEach player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the \"time track\" would move forward.\nIn addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the \"exchange rates\" of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.\n\nAt the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable). The highest score wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "163326", "name": "Seasons: Crystal Titan"}, {"id": "136233", "name": "Seasons: Enchanted Kingdom"}, {"id": "172153", "name": "Seasons: Geek d'Argos"}, {"id": "164015", "name": "Seasons: Igramul the Banisher"}, {"id": "166375", "name": "Seasons: Orb of Ragfield"}, {"id": "148166", "name": "Seasons: Path of Destiny"}, {"id": "164203", "name": "Seasons: Speedwall the Escaped"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 20383, "average": 7.41104, "bayesaverage": 7.24628, "stddev": 1.36248, "median": 0.0, "owned": 24026, "trading": 527, "wanting": 769, "wishing": 4764, "numcomments": 3343, "numweights": 884, "averageweight": 2.7715, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 208}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 157}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 472, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 223}, "2": {"best_rating": 319, "recommended_rating": 111, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "3": {"best_rating": 129, "recommended_rating": 244, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "4": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 150, "not_recommended_rating": 183}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 202}}}, "usersrated": 20383.0, "average": 7.41104, "bayesaverage": 7.24628, "stddev": 1.36248, "median": 0.0, "owned": 24026.0, "trading": 527.0, "wanting": 769.0, "wishing": 4764.0, "numcomments": 3343.0, "numweights": 884.0, "averageweight": 2.7715, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 208}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 157}], "game_family": "Seasons", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "232405", "name": "Western Legends", "alternative_names": ["Legendy Z\u00e1padu", "Vadnyugati Legend\u00e1k", "\u041b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u044b \u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430", "\u897f\u90e8\u50b3\u5947"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_FnP28QChh-8uFh6ZvpJhA__thumb/img/iq5peG7h6fe8_-nY_MJkG3QrYCg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3837503.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_FnP28QChh-8uFh6ZvpJhA__original/img/s1r6VNVeHEpMQ4zBOx6P3-dnqKA=/0x0/pic3837503.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Western Legends"], "categories": ["Adventure", "American West"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Betting and Bluffing", "Dice Rolling", "End Game Bonuses", "Hand Management", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Herv\u00e9 Lema\u00eetre"], "artists": ["Roland MacDonald"], "publishers": ["Kolossal Games", "Board Game Box", "Conclave Editora", "Funiverse", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Maldito Games", "Matagot", "MINDOK", "MS Edizioni", "Surfin' Meeple China"], "description": "Historic characters from the American Wild West face off and write new legends across the face of history!

Possible actions include: move on the map (how far depends on whether they have a mount), doing a location-specific action (such as mine for gold if they are at a gold mine, gamble if they're in a saloon, etc.), fight other players at the same location (either duel them, rob them, or arrest them if they're wanted), play poker cards that have action abilities, etc. Legendary Points (LPs) are earned based on the outcomes of many of these actions, and the winner is whoever has the most LPs at the end of the game.\n\nKey Points\n- Award-Winning gaming experience set in the American West!\n- Beautiful artwork, and presentation brings this highly thematic game to life.\n- Intuitive gameplay and choices let\u2019s you write your own legend every game!\n\nNote: The Russian edition of Western Legends contains 2 expansions packaged inside the box, therefore it has its own entry here: \u00d0\u203a\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00b4\u00d1\u2039 \u00d0\u00b4\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00be \u00d0\u00b7\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00bf\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00b4\u00d0\u00b0\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "267545", "name": "Western Legends: Ante Up"}, {"id": "295026", "name": "Western Legends: Blood Money"}, {"id": "272254", "name": "Western Legends: Carbine Promo Cards"}, {"id": "244936", "name": "Western Legends: Fistful of Extras"}, {"id": "272253", "name": "Western Legends: Man in Black Promo Card"}, {"id": "244935", "name": "Western Legends: The Good, the Bad, and the Handsome"}, {"id": "307233", "name": "Western Legends: The Man In Black \u2013 Multiplayer Variant Promo Cards"}, {"id": "270728", "name": "Western Legends: Wild Bunch of Extras"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 6082, "average": 7.67044, "bayesaverage": 7.17395, "stddev": 1.42242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10291, "trading": 123, "wanting": 622, "wishing": 3606, "numcomments": 1231, "numweights": 154, "averageweight": 2.7792, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 247}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 55}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 147, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 92}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 79}, "3": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 73, "not_recommended_rating": 23}, "4": {"best_rating": 94, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 41, "recommended_rating": 58, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "6": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 60}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 69}}}, "usersrated": 6082.0, "average": 7.67044, "bayesaverage": 7.17395, "stddev": 1.42242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10291.0, "trading": 123.0, "wanting": 622.0, "wishing": 3606.0, "numcomments": 1231.0, "numweights": 154.0, "averageweight": 2.7792, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 247}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 55}], "game_family": "Western Legends", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "163399", "name": "Infinity: Operation Icestorm", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uNI-2eynECLmV9BEyZZADg__thumb/img/uqkDk4KDWqdseAxb-ue7mif7-UA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2120569.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uNI-2eynECLmV9BEyZZADg__original/img/TcDp_CGECYaSyltgkc-6urxRMOI=/0x0/pic2120569.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Theme: Anime / Manga"], "categories": ["Fighting", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement"], "designers": ["Gutier Lusqui\u00f1os Rodr\u00edguez"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Corvus Belli"], "description": "\"The war goes to the frozen World of Svalarheima\"\n\nOperation: Icestorm introduces 3rd edition rules and is a perfect starter set for players wanting to get into Infinity game, providing forces of Pan Oceania and Nomads to engage in combat against one another.\n\nInfinity is a game with 28mm high metal miniatures that simulates combat and special operations in a science fiction environment with Manga aesthetics.\n\nThe box contains a game mat and a selection of scenery.

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons \u2014 the currency/points in the game \u2014 and someone is chosen as the start player.\n\nOn a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.\n\nIn addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn \"button income\": sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.\n\nWhat's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.\n\nAdditionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)\n\nWhen a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank.

Characters stay face up just long enough for players to more or less memorize them, then are turned face down. Your goal is to be the first player to hold 13 coins, and while you start nearly halfway to that goal, you can go down just as surely as you can go up!\n\nOn a turn you take one of three actions:\n\n1) Announce your character: Claim the power of a certain character and take the associated action. You don't have to have that character card in front of you to take this action, but if someone else says that they're that character and reveals the card to prove it, that player takes the action instead while you lose one coin to the tribunal.\n\n2) Swap cards or not: Take another player's character card along with yours, place them under the table, shuffle them around a bit, then give one card back to the other player while keeping one for yourself. You (presumably) know whether you changed characters and can have some idea of who you are now, but that other player might be in the dark.\n\n3) Secretly look at your character: Look at your character card to make sure of who you are.\n\nPlay continues until one player obtains 13 coins and wins!\n\nMascarade includes more character cards than the number of players, so not all characters will be used in each game. The rules suggest that you use certain characters in your first games, but once you know the game, you can try many other distributions. The first edition of Mascarade contains 13 characters. The beggar (woman) has no special ability. Bruno Faidutti says on his blog: \"...she has no ability so far. I always like to find blank cards in a game, for which I can imagine my own effects. Here, the card is not blank \u2013 it has a picture and a name, but you can devise its effect, and I'm sure there'll be some prize for the best idea.\"\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "163107", "name": "Mascarade: Expansion"}, {"id": "146565", "name": "Mascarade: The Damned"}, {"id": "144984", "name": "Mascarade: Usurper"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 13, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 9070, "average": 6.62105, "bayesaverage": 6.42697, "stddev": 1.41101, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13943, "trading": 412, "wanting": 168, "wishing": 1445, "numcomments": 1722, "numweights": 369, "averageweight": 1.5312, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1125}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 100}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 118, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 76}, "2": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 78}, "3": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 72}, "4": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 44}, "5": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 54, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "6": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 44, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "7": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "8": {"best_rating": 61, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "9": {"best_rating": 23, "recommended_rating": 54, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "10": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 55, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "11": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 38, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "12": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 35}, "13": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 26, "not_recommended_rating": 42}, "13+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 56}}}, "usersrated": 9070.0, "average": 6.62105, "bayesaverage": 6.42697, "stddev": 1.41101, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13943.0, "trading": 412.0, "wanting": 168.0, "wishing": 1445.0, "numcomments": 1722.0, "numweights": 369.0, "averageweight": 1.5312, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1125}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 100}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "7", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "228341", "name": "Pulsar 2849", "alternative_names": ["\u8108\u885d\u661f 2849", "\ud384\uc11c 2849"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NSF3OBldDuQIfLIav_eL9Q__thumb/img/vdTdCpJPHw6UM3_MTiwr8YkEliU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3736981.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NSF3OBldDuQIfLIav_eL9Q__original/img/rxYtkapNf8BCR-4XZaY4cxpmxUI=/0x0/pic3736981.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Mechanism: Dice Drafting"], "categories": ["Dice", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Drafting", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement with Dice Workers"], "designers": ["Vladim\u00edr Such\u00fd"], "artists": ["S\u00f6ren Meding"], "publishers": ["Czech Games Edition", "Asmodee", "Cranio Creations", "Devir", "DiceTree Games", "IELLO", "Lex Games", "One Moment Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "It is the year 2849, and humanity has harnessed the power of the pulsars.

And this truly has to be an honorable man.\n\nBasically this game is all about resource management and conflict, but unlike other games in this category you won't necessarily win, if you conquer the most areas. Your main goal is to earn enough honor, which can be achieved in different ways. There are two kinds of honor. 'Daimyo-Honor' is the victory condition and can be directly gained by holding provinces, and indirectly by transforming 'Samurai-Honor' at a set rate. 'Samurai-Honor' is gained by winning a defensive or offensive battle. It can be transformed into 'Daimyo-Honor' with a tea ceremony.\n\nThe first Daimyo who earns 50 points of honor wins the game. If this goal is not reached within 12 turns, the Daimyo with the most honor at that point wins the game.\n\nWhat needs special mentioning is the turn mechanism of the game, which is really cleverly-devised: depending on the number of players, different 'offices' are in the game that get assigned to the players. In a 4-player game these offices are:\n\nDaimyo: The active player. For clarification: in game terms, every player is a Daimyo, but only the active player acts as Daimyo. The Daimyo, as active player can restock his resources, attack a province and play special tiles. Most importantly, he assigns the other offices to his opponents.\n\nSamurai: The general. He will lead the attack in the Daimyo's name. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful attack.\n\nBushi: the poor guy who is attacked by the Daimyo. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful defense.\n\nSensei: He gives council to the Daimyo. Tricky position, because his council can do the Daimyo harm or good. He can cancel an attack, spy on other players, use Ronin to destabilize a province, and suggest to the Daimyo how hard to punish his Samurai    when he loses a battle.\n\nThe battles are resolved by a system that depends on the number of troops and a rock-paper-scissors element. The opponents have the possibility to improve their odds by investing some of their resources.\n\nThe tricky part of the game is that most of your actions depend at least partly on the goodwill of one of your opponents. For instance the Daimyo depends on the Samurai to win, but the Samurai will only do this, if he sees enough gain for himself. This makes the game very interactive, with much discussion and haggling at the table.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "57762", "name": "Bushido: Tanin the Stranger"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2008, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 261, "average": 6.23812, "bayesaverage": 5.58737, "stddev": 1.86979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 642, "trading": 76, "wanting": 14, "wishing": 80, "numcomments": 109, "numweights": 35, "averageweight": 3.6, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 7549}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1866}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 11, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 3}}}, "usersrated": 261.0, "average": 6.23812, "bayesaverage": 5.58737, "stddev": 1.86979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 642.0, "trading": 76.0, "wanting": 14.0, "wishing": 80.0, "numcomments": 109.0, "numweights": 35.0, "averageweight": 3.6, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 7549}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1866}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "67877", "name": "Anomia", "alternative_names": ["Anomia \u5b57\u5b57\u8f49\u6a5f", "Blitz!", "Blitzdings", "Duplex", "Na ko\u0144cu j\u0119zyka", "Ordet Fanger!", "Ordglapp", "Sanasota", "\u042d\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430", "\ube14\ub9ac\uce20"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OvOpd-Lhl7t3h9fF_qi6lQ__thumb/img/002NO49Pl3-9dPUj43StWt0SS2c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2527529.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OvOpd-Lhl7t3h9fF_qi6lQ__original/img/4OvUz1IRq3mkYbXD47WnUwg3sLI=/0x0/pic2527529.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Misc: Mensa Select"], "categories": ["Party Game", "Real-time", "Trivia", "Word Game"], "implementations": ["Anomia Kids", "Anomia X", "Anomia: Party Edition"], "mechanics": ["Pattern Recognition", "Speed Matching"], "designers": ["Andrew Innes"], "artists": ["Kinetic", "Paul Laane", "Cezary Szulc", "Peter Wocken"], "publishers": ["Anomia Press", "Asmodee", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Cocktail Games", "Coiledspring Games", "Competo / Marektoy", "Happy Baobab", "KOSMOS", "Magellan", "Nasza Ksi\u0119garnia", "Piatnik"], "description": "Anomia plays off the fact that our minds are positively brimming with all sorts of random information: things to eat, pop songs, websites, etc...

The positions of the villages are randomized for each player, so every game will provide a unique puzzle.\n\nEach turn, one player flips over two terrain cards. Each player must draw \u2014 on their own map \u2014 a trail between two neighboring spaces of the shown terrains. Gradually, the trails will grow into a network of roads. Players score points by connecting matching harbors, and by connecting sights to harbors. Being the first to connect a pair of harbors provides bonus points.\n\nTo add depth to the game, there are varying distribution of the different terrain cards. Mountain cards are for instance rarer than desert cards, so it would be harder to build a trail through a mountain range or over water than through desert or forest. Players need to take this into account when planning their routes. And they should maximize the probability that they will be able to make use of any combination of terrain cards that may come up.\n\n\u2014description from designer\n\nAWARDS AND HONORS:\n\n2020 Norwegian Game of the Year WINNER\n2020 Norwegian Game of the Year NOMINEE\n2019 The Dice Tower SEAL OF EXCELLENCE\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 15, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 15, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 1214, "average": 7.45021, "bayesaverage": 6.36356, "stddev": 1.0596, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1940, "trading": 17, "wanting": 148, "wishing": 771, "numcomments": 192, "numweights": 35, "averageweight": 1.3714, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1261}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 262}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 23, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "6": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "7": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "8": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "8+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 2}}}, "usersrated": 1214.0, "average": 7.45021, "bayesaverage": 6.36356, "stddev": 1.0596, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1940.0, "trading": 17.0, "wanting": 148.0, "wishing": 771.0, "numcomments": 192.0, "numweights": 35.0, "averageweight": 1.3714, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1261}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 262}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "283948", "name": "Marco Polo II: In the Service of the Khan", "alternative_names": ["Marco Polo II", "Marco Polo II: Agli Ordini del Khan", "Marco Polo II: Al servicio del Kan", "Marco Polo II: Ao Servi\u00e7o do Khan", "Marco Polo II: Im Auftrag des Khan", "Marco Polo II: Op bevel van de Khan", "\u99ac\u53ef\u6ce2\u7f85 II: \u53ef\u6c57\u7684\u8a17\u4ed8", "\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54 \ud3f4\ub85c 2: \uc704\ub300\ud55c \uce78\uc758 \uc774\ub984\uc73c\ub85c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DAgjwjk6qi1VSzv31MPKaQ__thumb/img/-WWZAnqvN9-nAMz_Di8t3t5xiW4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4970011.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DAgjwjk6qi1VSzv31MPKaQ__original/img/gbdMW4g34I10eRuPQPASM52Jc5A=/0x0/pic4970011.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Game: The Voyages of Marco Polo", "Theme: Silk Road"], "categories": ["Dice", "Economic", "Medieval", "Travel"], "implementations": ["The Voyages of Marco Polo"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement", "Worker Placement with Dice Workers"], "designers": ["Simone Luciani", "Daniele Tascini"], "artists": ["Dennis Lohausen"], "publishers": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "999 Games", "Albi", "Albi Polska", "Devir", "Giochi Uniti", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "The journeys of Marco Polo continue in Marco Polo II: In the Service of the Khan, an epic follow-up to The Voyages of Marco Polo.

MacGowan", "Mark Mahaffey"], "publishers": ["GMT Games"], "description": "The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.\n\nSekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord).\n\nThe campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.\n\nTo conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.\n\nSekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:\n\n        No dice are used\n        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.\n        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.\n        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.\n\n\n\n\nSekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.\n\nSekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.\n\nNo dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nLegitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.\n\nThe initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.\n\nBlocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.\n\nTrue to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.\n\nEach player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.\n\nTIME SCALE     1 week per 2-player turns\nMAP SCALE     Point to point\nUNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS     2\n\nCOMPONENTS\n    Mounted Map\n    119 wooden pieces\n    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets\n    110 cards\n    Rulebook\n    Two player aid cards\n\nDESIGNER: Matthew Calkins\nMAP, CARD, & BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey\n\n(source: GMT website)\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 4244, "average": 8.04636, "bayesaverage": 7.35158, "stddev": 1.26576, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7294, "trading": 120, "wanting": 595, "wishing": 2588, "numcomments": 1193, "numweights": 303, "averageweight": 2.7624, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 157}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 5}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 53, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "2": {"best_rating": 52, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 38}}}, "usersrated": 4244.0, "average": 8.04636, "bayesaverage": 7.35158, "stddev": 1.26576, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7294.0, "trading": 120.0, "wanting": 595.0, "wishing": 2588.0, "numcomments": 1193.0, "numweights": 303.0, "averageweight": 2.7624, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 157}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 5}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "25292", "name": "Merchants & Marauders", "alternative_names": ["Corsari dei Caraibi", "Fortunes de Mer", "Korsaren der Karibik", "Kupcy i Korsarze", "Merchants and Marauders", "Piraten & Kooplui", "\u5546\u4eba\u8207\u63a0\u596a\u8005"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__thumb/img/Rd6POAEmJOEtwKB7bSDTKPsL_9k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic738119.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__original/img/mNWaseFj2eSJP6VdhsIs9GdeYSs=/0x0/pic738119.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Region: Caribbean Sea", "Theme: Colonial", "Theme: Tropical"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fighting", "Nautical", "Pirates", "Transportation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Race", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Kasper Aagaard", "Christian Marcussen"], "artists": ["Ben Nelson", "Chris Quilliams"], "publishers": ["Z-Man Games, Inc.", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Conclave Editora", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Pegasus Spiele", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "White Goblin Games"], "description": "Merchants & Marauders lets you live the life of an influential merchant or a dreaded pirate in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy.

Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?\n\nIn Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 \"glory\" points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.\n\nA big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn \"pirate\" or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "161167", "name": "Merchants & Marauders: Seas of Glory"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 12558, "average": 7.41877, "bayesaverage": 7.16543, "stddev": 1.47556, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17217, "trading": 386, "wanting": 965, "wishing": 4891, "numcomments": 2842, "numweights": 806, "averageweight": 3.2395, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 255}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 72}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 296, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 129}, "2": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 151, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "3": {"best_rating": 107, "recommended_rating": 126, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4": {"best_rating": 163, "recommended_rating": 74, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 122}}}, "usersrated": 12558.0, "average": 7.41877, "bayesaverage": 7.16543, "stddev": 1.47556, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17217.0, "trading": 386.0, "wanting": 965.0, "wishing": 4891.0, "numcomments": 2842.0, "numweights": 806.0, "averageweight": 3.2395, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 255}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 72}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "156129", "name": "Deception: Murder in Hong Kong", "alternative_names": ["Asesinato en Hong Kong", "B\u0171njelek: Gyilkoss\u00e1g Hongkongban", "CS-Files", "Dochodzenie: Detektywi kontra seryjny zab\u00f3jca", "Get\u00e4uscht: Mord in Hong Kong", "\u041a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442: \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0432 \u0413\u043e\u043d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0433\u0435", "\u041a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442: \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0432 \u0413\u043e\u043d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0433\u0435", "\u72af\u7f6a\u73fe\u5834", "\ub514\uc149\uc158: \ud64d\ucf69 \uc0b4\uc778 \uc0ac\uac74"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1COY3oeK9aN2_XNimKaNww__thumb/img/8IWDjnSYX-tYAVRgfq-W3y1b_Ww=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3033330.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1COY3oeK9aN2_XNimKaNww__original/img/hGE79VL3d5Kv8dIXehMPafkacI4=/0x0/pic3033330.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Hong Kong", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Deception \u2013 Murder in Hong Kong"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Murder/Mystery", "Party Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Deduction", "Hidden Roles", "Storytelling", "Team-Based Game", "Traitor Game"], "designers": ["Tobey Ho"], "artists": ["Marcin Adamski", "Ben Carre", "Tommy Ng", "Ari Wong"], "publishers": ["Jolly Thinkers", "Across the Board", "Angry Lion Games", "Do it games", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Grey Fox Games", "IELLO", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Lucrum Games", "Popcorn Games", "sternenschimmermeer"], "description": "Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes.\n\nIn the game, players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case \u2013 but there's a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!\n\nThe Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!\n\nFind out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!\n\nRoles\n\nForensic Scientist x1\nAs the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder.\u201d When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.\n\nDuring the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.\n\nMurderer x1\nWhen the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder\u201d respectively.\n\nThe Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and the \u201cMeans of Murder\u201d.\n\nInvestigators x8\nTo solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder,\u201d the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).\n\nBear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.\n\nAccomplice x1\nThe Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.\n\nWitness x1\nThe Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.\n\nIf the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "234719", "name": "Deception/CS-Files Theme Pack: North

And with Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.\n\nThe Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of

On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.\n\nPlayers take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected. (A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.) You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4,

In the ensuing battle, the power liberated by the combatants ignites in a combustion that shatters the Earth. In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.\n\nAs they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal. Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image.\n\nThe world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland. Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx. Would that have been the extent of the underworld's involvement however...\n\nHades, having lost the majority of his power, no longer holds sway over the Underworld. The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface.\n\nAs a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power.\n\nIn Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game. Choose your God, draft your warband and take the fight to your enemies with the might of the most powerful beings from Greek mythology at your back.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "257932", "name": "Compendium: The Overlord \u2013 Tome III (fan expansion for Mythic Battles: Pantheon)"}, {"id": "218878", "name": "Corinthia: A Conan / Mythic Battles \u2013 Pantheon Crossover"}, {"id": "220158", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 3D Terrain Set"}, {"id": "242993", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Atlas"}, {"id": "219999", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Compendium"}, {"id": "255505", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Dionysus"}, {"id": "218877", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Echidna's Children"}, {"id": "245785", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Extension Kit"}, {"id": "218880", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Hephaistos"}, {"id": "218879", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Hera Expansion"}, {"id": "218884", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Heroes of the Trojan Wars"}, {"id": "218883", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Judges of the Underworld"}, {"id": "218886", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Ketos"}, {"id": "218882", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Manticore"}, {"id": "218881", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Oedipus Vs. the Sphinx"}, {"id": "220000", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Pandora's Box"}, {"id": "218885", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Paolo Parente's Guest Box"}, {"id": "213527", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Poseidon Expansion"}, {"id": "218876", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Rise of the Titans"}, {"id": "242274", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Thermopylae Battlefield"}, {"id": "255504", "name": "Mythic Battles: Pantheon \u2013 Ymir"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 2484, "average": 8.47053, "bayesaverage": 7.0985, "stddev": 1.49224, "median": 0.0, "owned": 5149, "trading": 94, "wanting": 217, "wishing": 1121, "numcomments": 708, "numweights": 100, "averageweight": 3.01, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 304}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 170}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 68, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "2": {"best_rating": 54, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 31, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "4": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 37}}}, "usersrated": 2484.0, "average": 8.47053, "bayesaverage": 7.0985, "stddev": 1.49224, "median": 0.0, "owned": 5149.0, "trading": 94.0, "wanting": 217.0, "wishing": 1121.0, "numcomments": 708.0, "numweights": 100.0, "averageweight": 3.01, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 304}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 170}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 21, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "186904", "name": "The Champion of the Wild", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tx8LlBqCL53SiA6supOOlg__thumb/img/5v1dfYo-JY_g8YML0fv4KCrK8U0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3750307.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tx8LlBqCL53SiA6supOOlg__original/img/c_kXTOqH1gszyC1r5SigmsOgi2o=/0x0/pic3750307.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "categories": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Humor", "Party Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Voting"], "designers": ["Tom Clare"], "artists": ["Kevin Chapman", "Dave Heaton", "Dan Misson"], "publishers": ["Big Imagination Games"], "description": "The Champion of the Wild, formerly known as The Animal Games, is a light-hearted card-based social game for 3-8 players based on the following theme:\n\nPlayers have attained super-stardom and handsome riches over many years due to their innate ability to communicate with and to coach animals of all different species.

Votes score points for the appropriate players and the player with the most points after three events wins.\n\nThe Champion of the Wild combines the fun and laughter of a conversation-driven social game with the challenge of strategic thinking required for animal selection and event tactics.\n\nWho will be your champion?\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 35, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 35, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 283, "average": 6.98746, "bayesaverage": 5.72976, "stddev": 1.43051, "median": 0.0, "owned": 688, "trading": 28, "wanting": 46, "wishing": 278, "numcomments": 71, "numweights": 8, "averageweight": 1.125, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4357}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 258}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 4, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "6": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "7": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "8": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "8+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 2}}}, "usersrated": 283.0, "average": 6.98746, "bayesaverage": 5.72976, "stddev": 1.43051, "median": 0.0, "owned": 688.0, "trading": 28.0, "wanting": 46.0, "wishing": 278.0, "numcomments": 71.0, "numweights": 8.0, "averageweight": 1.125, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4357}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 258}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "177736", "name": "A Feast for Odin", "alternative_names": ["\u00c0 la gloire d'Odin", "Um Banquete a Odin", "El Banquete de Od\u00edn", "Ein Fest f\u00fcr Odin", "La Festa per Odino", "Odin", "Uczta Dla Odyna", "Uczta u Odyna", "\u0412\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0443 \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u795d\u796d", "\u5967\u4e01\u7684\u76db\u5bb4", "\uc624\ub518\uc744 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__thumb/img/AKxMMz2DTbBrEynhDROla8fdjJ4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3146943.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__original/img/h0P5NRuVBu0GuDrJo7CHAiSJo3U=/0x0/pic3146943.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Components: Polyominoes", "Country: Iceland", "Game: A Feast for Odin", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Mythology: Norse", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg)", "Theme: Food / Cooking", "Theme: Vikings"], "categories": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Medieval", "Puzzle"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Automatic Resource Growth", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Coverage", "Income", "Push Your Luck", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tile Placement", "Turn Order: Pass Order", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Dennis Lohausen"], "publishers": ["Feuerland Spiele", "Cranio Creations", "Devir", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Game Harbor", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lacerta", "Mandala Jogos", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)", "White Goblin Games", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game.

Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.\nIn what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.\n\nIn this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society.

The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.\n\nThe game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.\n\nThe core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.\n\nImprovements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.\n\nThe \"Chronicles\" in the title \u2014 a set of eight expansions to the base game \u2014 are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The \"Highland Boat Race\" Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The \"Hammer of the Scots\" Chronicle adds a neutral \"Englishman\" playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn \u2014 if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a \"monster game\".\n\nAnother major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new \"person\" tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "326956", "name": "Glen More II: Chronicles \u2013 Feed the Kraken Mini Chronicle"}, {"id": "292921", "name": "Glen More II: Chronicles \u2013 Promo 2"}, {"id": "292621", "name": "Glen More II: Chronicles \u2013 What Lurks Beneath"}, {"id": "313646", "name": "Glen More II: Highland Games"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 3072, "average": 8.04041, "bayesaverage": 7.1781, "stddev": 1.13979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 5966, "trading": 40, "wanting": 512, "wishing": 2154, "numcomments": 633, "numweights": 119, "averageweight": 3.042, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 244}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 124}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 59, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "2": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "3": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 26, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 26}}}, "usersrated": 3072.0, "average": 8.04041, "bayesaverage": 7.1781, "stddev": 1.13979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 5966.0, "trading": 40.0, "wanting": 512.0, "wishing": 2154.0, "numcomments": 633.0, "numweights": 119.0, "averageweight": 3.042, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 244}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 124}], "game_family": "Glen More", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "265285", "name": "Queenz: To Bee or Not to Bee", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7DOwOXeX4cY8_aPuXnm3NQ__thumb/img/SgENUaPTi24f46CgbO0C6ubfptw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4680550.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7DOwOXeX4cY8_aPuXnm3NQ__original/img/vNzLRnZPsrOunWvabi1Sgl9QQ8s=/0x0/pic4680550.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Bees", "Animals: Insects", "Components: Polyominoes"], "categories": ["Animals", "Farming"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Pattern Building", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Bruno Cathala", "Johannes Goupy"], "artists": ["Vincent Dutrait"], "publishers": ["Mandoo Games", "Arclight", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Maldito Games", "Rio Grande Games", "Studio Supernova", "TLAMA games", "TWOPLUS Games"], "description": "Players are beekeepers, trying to bloom their fields in order to attract bees and to produce the most valuable honey of the country.\n\nOn your turn, you have 2 choices:\n1) Taking new flower tokens from the garden and keeping them in your warehouse.\n\n     1 any or 2 of a kind or 3 different colors.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Blooming one field\n\n     Select 1 field from the pool (expanding your own field) and fill the field with flower tokens in your stock and your hive token. \n     Get 1 VP for each flower of this field. \n     Fill your personal track with the honey jar of corresponding color. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a player blooms his 5th field, every players has one last turn.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.\n\nThe game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.\n\nThe game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.

If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.

For each mat in the basic game, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.\n\nEach player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked \"1\". You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the highest-valued money associated with it, then the player with the secondmost dice takes the next highest-valued money card. In case of a tie, the non-tied player with the most dice takes the highest-valued money card at that casino, while the tied players get bupkis.\n\nLas Vegas Royale includes twelve expansion tiles, and to play a more involved game, you can place an expansion tile at random by each casino. These tiles have special abilities on them, and by placing dice on them, players can activate these abilities.

Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that's as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player's 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy).\n\nWhen a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located. In addition, you can't place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round.

Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.\n\nIn the end, the player with the best kingdom\u2014and not the richest player\u2014becomes the sovereign of the island.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "205611", "name": "Deutscher Spielepreis 2016 Goodie Box"}, {"id": "246646", "name": "Isle of Skye: Druids"}, {"id": "211945", "name": "Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King \u2013 Adjacency Scrolls"}, {"id": "186067", "name": "Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King \u2013 Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015 Promo Tiles"}, {"id": "205159", "name": "Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King \u2013 Kennerspiel des Jahres Promo Tile"}, {"id": "211116", "name": "Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King \u2013 Themenpl\u00e4ttchen"}, {"id": "238470", "name": "Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King \u2013 Tunnelpl\u00e4ttchen"}, {"id": "263960", "name": "Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King \u2013 Tunnelpl\u00e4ttchen 2"}, {"id": "232226", "name": "Isle of Skye: Journeyman"}, {"id": "291421", "name": "Isle of Skye: Pe\u00e7as Promocionais"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 50, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 50, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 19828, "average": 7.43889, "bayesaverage": 7.28161, "stddev": 1.14667, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25785, "trading": 392, "wanting": 722, "wishing": 3863, "numcomments": 3004, "numweights": 571, "averageweight": 2.2399, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 191}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 147}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 30}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 330, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 188}, "2": {"best_rating": 31, "recommended_rating": 155, "not_recommended_rating": 89}, "3": {"best_rating": 153, "recommended_rating": 115, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 175, "recommended_rating": 95, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "5": {"best_rating": 48, "recommended_rating": 149, "not_recommended_rating": 41}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 135}}}, "usersrated": 19828.0, "average": 7.43889, "bayesaverage": 7.28161, "stddev": 1.14667, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25785.0, "trading": 392.0, "wanting": 722.0, "wishing": 3863.0, "numcomments": 3004.0, "numweights": 571.0, "averageweight": 2.2399, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 191}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 147}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 30}], "game_family": "Isle of Skye (Lookout Games)", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 11, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "256237", "name": "Dixit: 10th Anniversary", "alternative_names": ["Dixit 10.

In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.\n\nBut wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.\"\n\n\u2014description from the back of the box\n\nIn Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can \"buy\" as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.\n\nDominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck.

color-blindness and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds. The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.\n\nIn the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.\n\nAt the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "145148", "name": "Patronage (fan expansion for Race for the Galaxy)"}, {"id": "92932", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Alien Artifacts"}, {"id": "270439", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Das Erweiterungs-Bundle"}, {"id": "242309", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: New Worlds Promo"}, {"id": "40210", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Rebel vs Imperium"}, {"id": "268829", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Retrofit Cards"}, {"id": "66121", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: The Brink of War"}, {"id": "34499", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm"}, {"id": "161599", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Invasion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2007, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 45635, "average": 7.75988, "bayesaverage": 7.65738, "stddev": 1.48202, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54949, "trading": 1058, "wanting": 1104, "wishing": 8627, "numcomments": 9514, "numweights": 3445, "averageweight": 2.9808, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 57}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 55}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1056, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 96, "not_recommended_rating": 451}, "2": {"best_rating": 683, "recommended_rating": 272, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "3": {"best_rating": 333, "recommended_rating": 531, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "4": {"best_rating": 406, "recommended_rating": 415, "not_recommended_rating": 62}, "4+": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 92, "not_recommended_rating": 388}}}, "usersrated": 45635.0, "average": 7.75988, "bayesaverage": 7.65738, "stddev": 1.48202, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54949.0, "trading": 1058.0, "wanting": 1104.0, "wishing": 8627.0, "numcomments": 9514.0, "numweights": 3445.0, "averageweight": 2.9808, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 57}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 55}], "game_family": "Race for the Galaxy", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "28259", "name": "Cutthroat Caverns", "alternative_names": ["Sang Rancune", "\u5272\u5589\u63a2\u96aa\u968a"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/38jw1p0ZcayPgLJuZyPVyA__thumb/img/dLfS2NrthAEMFa8A5-5Xd1jNZAg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic249004.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/38jw1p0ZcayPgLJuZyPVyA__original/img/xBDmCvX4ogUCm3tPFsSxrY7yYbk=/0x0/pic249004.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Cutthroat Caverns"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Humor"], "implementations": ["Cutthroat Caverns: Anniversary Edition"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Kill Steal", "Player Elimination", "Semi-Cooperative Game", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Take That"], "designers": ["Curt Covert"], "artists": ["Paul Adam", "Justin Brunetto", "Curt Covert", "Ian Field-Richards", "Henri H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen", "Noel Hill", "Mats Holmgren", "Mark Jernstrom", "Bruno Krippahl", "Eric R.

The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.\n\nThe game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation.\n\n(Based on a description from Czech Games Edition)\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "90133", "name": "Little Duckling (fan expansion for Space Alert)"}, {"id": "61492", "name": "Space Alert: The New Frontier"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2008, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 14652, "average": 7.44092, "bayesaverage": 7.23261, "stddev": 1.57356, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20503, "trading": 648, "wanting": 781, "wishing": 5144, "numcomments": 3360, "numweights": 783, "averageweight": 2.9617, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 212}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 65}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 325, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 154}, "2": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 91, "not_recommended_rating": 140}, "3": {"best_rating": 19, "recommended_rating": 150, "not_recommended_rating": 77}, "4": {"best_rating": 203, "recommended_rating": 89, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 219, "recommended_rating": 69, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 133}}}, "usersrated": 14652.0, "average": 7.44092, "bayesaverage": 7.23261, "stddev": 1.57356, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20503.0, "trading": 648.0, "wanting": 781.0, "wishing": 5144.0, "numcomments": 3360.0, "numweights": 783.0, "averageweight": 2.9617, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 212}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 65}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "294484", "name": "Unmatched: Cobble & Fog", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iyIO6udRfIn0xM1rIxyO2g__thumb/img/oKVEm_nmurLwHbp9QPNNEyJkzeE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5056685.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iyIO6udRfIn0xM1rIxyO2g__original/img/66Du9BuK_JvmChx5E7WbiTiaIx4=/0x0/pic5056685.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Books: Dracula", "Books: Sherlock Holmes", "Game: Unmatched"], "categories": ["Book", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Novel-based"], "implementations": ["Star Wars: Epic Duels"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Hand Management", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Rob Daviau", "Justin D.

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies.\n\nDetective: CoA uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O'Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy's Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they're wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve.\n\nDetective: CoA includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and \"hot\" leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience.\n\nInspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A.

Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.\n\nThe more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?\n\nRailroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add special rules to your games. The Blazing Red Edition includes the Lava and  Meteor expansions. Try to confine the lava coming from the erupting volcano before it destroys your routes, or deal with the havoc brought by the meteor strikes and mine the craters for precious ore. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different.\n\nEach box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more). The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "320731", "name": "Railroad Ink: Arcade Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320730", "name": "Railroad Ink: Eldritch Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320737", "name": "Railroad Ink: Electricity Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320734", "name": "Railroad Ink: Engineer Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320735", "name": "Railroad Ink: Future Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "263963", "name": "Railroad Ink: Promo Board #1 \u2013 Blue Train"}, {"id": "263964", "name": "Railroad Ink: Promo Board #2 \u2013 Red Train"}, {"id": "320736", "name": "Railroad Ink: Sky Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320732", "name": "Railroad Ink: Underground Expansion Pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 3503, "average": 7.19973, "bayesaverage": 6.6689, "stddev": 1.16313, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7051, "trading": 88, "wanting": 184, "wishing": 875, "numcomments": 508, "numweights": 53, "averageweight": 1.434, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 751}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 165}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 38, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "2": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 11}}}, "usersrated": 3503.0, "average": 7.19973, "bayesaverage": 6.6689, "stddev": 1.16313, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7051.0, "trading": 88.0, "wanting": 184.0, "wishing": 875.0, "numcomments": 508.0, "numweights": 53.0, "averageweight": 1.434, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 751}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 165}], "game_family": "Railroad Ink", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "251890", "name": "Gunkimono", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j7WFf1TQoh8HxRH_dHexqg__thumb/img/hZRKBaN8yfPfIWRHot5f1XEQ320=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4103445.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j7WFf1TQoh8HxRH_dHexqg__original/img/oiKMUBydD_vymPhMgPMyWjEUqlg=/0x0/pic4103445.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Japan", "Misc: Mensa Select", "Theme: Samurai"], "categories": ["Medieval", "Territory Building"], "implementations": ["Heartland"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Enclosure", "Hand Management", "Layering", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Jeffrey D.

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.\n\nTaking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:\n\n\n    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)\n    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)\n    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)\n    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)\n    Forest (Witches, Auren)\n    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)\n    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)\n\n\nProximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica.

Each player starts the game with a basic deck of cards, and they can acquire new cards from a central display of six cards (as in Ascension) and add these new cards to their deck or use them immediately, depending on what they are.\n\nEvery character starts with fifty health and zero mastery. On each turn, you can spend one gem (a.k.a., money) to gain a mastery point. The more mastery you have, the more powerful your cards become. This lets even the weak cards in your starting deck become more powerful as the game progresses. If you reach a total of thirty mastery, you can activate your Infinity Shard, which instantly defeats your opponent.\n\nAs you acquire new cards, you can employ allies and champions to craft your strategy. Mercenary cards can be added to your deck as in other deck-building games or they can be played immediately from the center row for their ability; this adds even more drama to each player's turn as a key mercenary flip can alter the very outcome of the game!\n\nWill you neutralize your opponents before they can fully master the Infinity Shard? With careful planning and aggressive gameplay, only one player can emerge the winner!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "269325", "name": "Shards of Infinity: Datic Inquisitors Promo Card"}, {"id": "254466", "name": "Shards of Infinity: Gian, Shard Wyrm Promo Card"}, {"id": "313056", "name": "Shards of Infinity: Into the Horizon"}, {"id": "270254", "name": "Shards of Infinity: Lasav, Tower Commander Promo Card"}, {"id": "257747", "name": "Shards of Infinity: Querry Monk Promo Card"}, {"id": "257379", "name": "Shards of Infinity: Relics of the Future"}, {"id": "283173", "name": "Shards of Infinity: Shadow of Salvation"}, {"id": "286625", "name": "Shards of Infinity: Subversion Elders Promo Card"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 2280, "average": 7.53984, "bayesaverage": 6.67426, "stddev": 1.2264, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3946, "trading": 100, "wanting": 139, "wishing": 903, "numcomments": 503, "numweights": 40, "averageweight": 2.025, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 744}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 405}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 52, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "2": {"best_rating": 42, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 24}}}, "usersrated": 2280.0, "average": 7.53984, "bayesaverage": 6.67426, "stddev": 1.2264, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3946.0, "trading": 100.0, "wanting": 139.0, "wishing": 903.0, "numcomments": 503.0, "numweights": 40.0, "averageweight": 2.025, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 744}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 405}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "recommendations": "DT"}, {"id": "244191", "name": "Nagaraja", "alternative_names": ["Naga Raja"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BhWG7lpcdeDtgREf_qoxnw__thumb/img/A05JkFIHJGHpkTvNu2jgNxFx5M0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4584504.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BhWG7lpcdeDtgREf_qoxnw__original/img/KwxW7zRJ51RBtdeWfThjAfgV1LQ=/0x0/pic4584504.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Players: Two Player Only Games"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Bluffing", "Exploration", "Maze"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Network and Route Building", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Bruno Cathala", "Th\u00e9o Rivi\u00e8re"], "artists": ["Vincent Dutrait"], "publishers": ["G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hurrican"], "description": "Twin temples of two forgotten divinities containing ancient relics have been discovered in India.

A treasure race packed with tough choices, twists & turns!\n\nIn this 2-players game, each player moves around their own temple, which has spaces for room tiles and hiding places for 9 sacred and cursed relics around.

However, a player loses if they reveal all three cursed relics! Each round, the players compete to win a new room tile by using cards allowing them to throw fate sticks. The player with the most fate points\nshowing on their sticks wins the room tile and places it in their temple.

Not only will characters be able to experience new adventure in Middle Earth, but we will carefully seek to tie in the experience with the massive amounts of lore and story that takes place around the edges of the central THE LORD OF THE RINGS storyline.\n\nMiddle-Earth Quest is a game of adventure and conflict set in the time leading up to the creation of the Fellowship. One player will adopt the mantle of Sauron and do his best to spread his evil influence across the lands. Up to three players become heroes and will do their best to foil Sauron's foul plots, and rally the peoples of Middle-earth to their side.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2009, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 3918, "average": 7.37777, "bayesaverage": 6.81405, "stddev": 1.42093, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6071, "trading": 168, "wanting": 322, "wishing": 1450, "numcomments": 1137, "numweights": 365, "averageweight": 3.5534, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 555}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 122}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 135, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 59}, "2": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 65, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "3": {"best_rating": 81, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 28, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 54}}}, "usersrated": 3918.0, "average": 7.37777, "bayesaverage": 6.81405, "stddev": 1.42093, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6071.0, "trading": 168.0, "wanting": 322.0, "wishing": 1450.0, "numcomments": 1137.0, "numweights": 365.0, "averageweight": 3.5534, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 555}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 122}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "113294", "name": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple", "alternative_names": ["Escape: A Templom \u00e1tka", "Escape: Chr\u00e1mov\u00e1 Kletba", "Escape: Chr\u00e1mov\u00e1 Kliatba", "Escape: Der Fluch des Tempels", "Escape: La Malediction du Temple", "Ucieczka: \u015awi\u0105tynia zag\u0142ady"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m6269wyfWVa7gZp3oXKx6A__thumb/img/WPqYsCIpVURoB_rdqRLgZptWNV8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3328521.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m6269wyfWVa7gZp3oXKx6A__original/img/SrdNn3Q5PScNpgUP85VFfAXR3mY=/0x0/pic3328521.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Compact Discs (CDs)", "Components: Dice with Icons", "Components: Official Music Soundtrack", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Escape (Queen Games)", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Yellow Wave Box (Queen)", "Theme: Archaeology / Paleontology"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Dice", "Electronic", "Exploration", "Real-time"], "implementations": ["Escape: Roll & Write", "Escape: Zombie City"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Elapsed Real Time Ending", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Push Your Luck", "Re-rolling and Locking", "Real-Time", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Kristian Amundsen \u00d8stby"], "artists": ["Oliver Schlemmer"], "publishers": ["Queen Games", "Br\u00e4dspel.se", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.\n\nThe initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile \u2013 the safe room \u2013 and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:\n\n\n    A cursed mask \u2013 this die is set aside when rolled.\n    A golden mask \u2013 each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.\n    A red torch or blue key \u2013 these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.\n    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die \u2013 you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.\n\n\nEscape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you \"discover\" magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.\n\nThe real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.\n\nOnce the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.\n\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the \"Treasures\" module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the \"Curses\" module, some tiles \"curse\" players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "310234", "name": "Escape: Queenie Box"}, {"id": "310200", "name": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple \u2013 Dice Shrine Chambers"}, {"id": "128236", "name": "Escape:

You are a powerful ship owner in search of wealth from the recently discovered Mundus Novus (New World). Your goal: Charter fleets of caravels to collect valuable goods (including the legendary Inca relics) and trade to form the best sets to expand your business empire and make your fortune.\n\nThe game is played using two decks of cards: a deck of resource cards, which contains cards representing ten different resources, and a deck of development cards, which give special benefits to their owners. The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of four phases:\n\nEach round starts with the Event phase, in which a random event may occur that affects all players.\n\nThe next phase is the Supply phase. Each player receives five random resource cards, plus one resource card for each caravel (a type of development card) that he owns, chosen from a common pool.\n\nThen, during the Trade phase, the players trade some of their cards. One of the players, the Trade Master, determines how many resource cards (2, 3 or 4) each player must offer for trade. The player that offers the resources with the highest value becomes the new Trade Master. He chooses one of the resources offered by one of the other players, and adds it to his hand, or exchanges it with a card from the market (three face-up cards that are available for such exchanges). Then, the player that he has taken a card from gets to take a card, and so on, until all the cards have been taken.\n\nFinally, during the Progression phase, the players exchange their resources for doubloons and developments. A player may exchange one set of three or more of the same resource for a development. Bigger combinations and rarer resources will allow more choice of which development can be selected from the five that are on offer. In addition, players can exchange sets of three or more different goods for doubloons, with bigger combinations earning more doubloons.\n\nIf a player can make a combination of ten different cards (i.e., one of each type of resource), he wins the game. Alternatively, if a player has accumulated 75 doubloons, he wins the game. If no player has achieved victory by the time the development deck runs out, the player who has accumulated the most doubloons wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "115773", "name": "Mundus Novus Promo Cards"}, {"id": "126706", "name": "Mundus Novus: Vers de Nouveaux Horizons"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 1716, "average": 6.69001, "bayesaverage": 6.12803, "stddev": 1.21687, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2332, "trading": 124, "wanting": 136, "wishing": 554, "numcomments": 444, "numweights": 102, "averageweight": 2.1863, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1897}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 935}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 521}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 32, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "2": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "3": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "6": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 11}}}, "usersrated": 1716.0, "average": 6.69001, "bayesaverage": 6.12803, "stddev": 1.21687, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2332.0, "trading": 124.0, "wanting": 136.0, "wishing": 554.0, "numcomments": 444.0, "numweights": 102.0, "averageweight": 2.1863, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1897}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 935}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 521}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "103885", "name": "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game", "alternative_names": ["Star Wars X-Wing: El juego de miniaturas \u2013 Caja B\u00e1sica", "Star Wars: X-wing figur\u00e1s j\u00e1t\u00e9k", "Star Wars: X-Wing Gioco di Miniature", "Star Wars: X-Wing Gra Figurkowa", "Star Wars: X-Wing Jogo de Miniaturas", "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniaturen-Spiel \u2013 Grundspiel", "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game \u2013 Core Set", "Star Wars: X-Wing \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0430\u0442\u044e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438", "Star Wars: X-Wing \u2013 Le Jeu de Figurines", "Star Wars: X-Wing \ubbf8\ub2c8\uc5b4\ucc98 \uac8c\uc784", "Star Wars: X-\u7ffc\u6230\u6a5f \u6838\u5fc3\u88dd"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yNqgVxaqoZepir7Hzkfe-Q__thumb/img/idalbLcUm2q9yxVZzRDkLEax5AE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1603292.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yNqgVxaqoZepir7Hzkfe-Q__original/img/6GthoJMvWgSpxVoWF1TEbMtXWd4=/0x0/pic1603292.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures Game", "Movies: Star Wars", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Series: FlightPath (Fantasy Flight Game)", "Space: Asteroids"], "categories": ["Aviation / Flight", "Bluffing", "Collectible Components", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "implementations": ["Dungeons & Dragons: Attack Wing", "Star Trek: Attack Wing", "Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Critical Hits and Failures", "Dice Rolling", "Movement Template", "Player Elimination", "Simulation", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Jason Little"], "artists": ["Matt Allsopp", "Sacha Angel Diener", "Jon Bosco", "Matt Bradbury", "Blake Henriksen", "Jason Juta", "Lucasfilm Ltd.", "Henning Ludvigsen", "Jorge Maese", "Dallas Mehlhoff", "Scott Murphy", "David Auden Nash", "Vlad Ricean", "Matthew Starbuck", "Nicholas Stohlman", "Angela Sung"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "cutia.ro", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Martinex", "Peliko", "Stratelibri", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "description": "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!\n\nWhatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.\n\nStar Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...\n\nThe Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.\n\nReimplemented by Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "129430", "name": "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game \u2013 A-Wing Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "235606",

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a \"home\" tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.\n\nIn spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.\n\nKeyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.\n\nKeyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the \"Key\" series from R&D Games set in the medieval \"Key\" land.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "256951", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018"}, {"id": "162647", "name": "Keyflower: Beekeeper"}, {"id": "245169", "name": "Keyflower: Boat 7"}, {"id": "264045", "name": "Keyflower: Delivery Man"}, {"id": "261369", "name": "Keyflower: Developer"}, {"id": "141816", "name": "Keyflower: Emporium & Monument"}, {"id": "140936", "name": "Keyflower: Key Celeste"}, {"id": "205504", "name": "Keyflower: Keymelequin"}, {"id": "180037", "name": "Keyflower: Pig Shelter"}, {"id": "245170", "name": "Keyflower: Sorcerer"}, {"id": "147380", "name": "Keyflower: Storyteller"}, {"id": "144058", "name": "Keyflower: The Farmers"}, {"id": "163572", "name": "Keyflower: The Merchants"}, {"id": "163742", "name": "Keyflower: Trader"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 18622, "average": 7.80783, "bayesaverage": 7.6243, "stddev": 1.30568, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21745, "trading": 317, "wanting": 1217, "wishing": 5761, "numcomments": 3359, "numweights": 878, "averageweight": 3.3462, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 65}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 54}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 350, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 146}, "2": {"best_rating": 60, "recommended_rating": 187, "not_recommended_rating": 41}, "3": {"best_rating": 114, "recommended_rating": 151, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4": {"best_rating": 188, "recommended_rating": 87, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 41, "recommended_rating": 141, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "6": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 110, "not_recommended_rating": 89}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 118}}}, "usersrated": 18622.0, "average": 7.80783, "bayesaverage": 7.6243, "stddev": 1.30568, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21745.0, "trading": 317.0, "wanting": 1217.0, "wishing": 5761.0, "numcomments": 3359.0, "numweights": 878.0, "averageweight": 3.3462, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 65}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 54}], "game_family": "Keyflower", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "158435", "name": "Dogs of War", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pN_2LoK9ICB6TD5h3QSPAQ__thumb/img/5T3HgkcVHmIDMXEgEi42T_ZyJLg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2682914.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pN_2LoK9ICB6TD5h3QSPAQ__original/img/sZho8jZ3THwS6flUymfMQnrWzJY=/0x0/pic2682914.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Theme: Steampunk"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Fantasy", "Negotiation", "Renaissance", "Wargame"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Paolo Mori"], "artists": ["Mathieu Harlaut", "Christophe Madura"], "publishers": ["Asmodee", "Cool Mini Or Not", "Edge Entertainment", "Pendragon Game Studio", "Spaghetti Western Games"], "description": "Dogs of War is an elegant game set in a steampunk-influenced renaissance universe. Noble houses engage each other in a series of fierce battles, and it's up to the players and the Dogs of War they control to deploy their private armies in support of whatever house they wish to favor. Clockwork knights and imposing war machines shift the tides of war as they enter the battlefields, but the interest of their Dog of War captains actually lie in the rewards offered by each noble house to its supporters. Each Dog of War has a special ability that helps them claim influence, win battles, or betray the house to which they've sworn allegiance!\n\nDogs of War is not a game of pure military power, but rather a game in which deception and betrayal often lead the way to a decisive victory. The goal for the Dogs of War is to earn the most power by the end of the game. Thanks to thoughtful game design and development, there are many ways to achieve this, like defeating other captains in battle, getting rewards from the Houses you help, amassing gold and troops, and most importantly, gaining influence with the most successful Houses.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "169247", "name": "Dogs of War: Kickstarter Exclusives"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 75, "minplaytime": 75, "maxplaytime": 75, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 2465, "average": 7.52328, "bayesaverage": 6.72936, "stddev": 1.27797, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3591, "trading": 84, "wanting": 241, "wishing": 904, "numcomments": 580, "numweights": 88, "averageweight": 2.6591, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 667}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 353}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 62, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 29}, "3": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 18, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "4": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 38, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 51, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 18}}}, "usersrated": 2465.0, "average": 7.52328, "bayesaverage": 6.72936, "stddev": 1.27797, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3591.0, "trading": 84.0, "wanting": 241.0, "wishing": 904.0, "numcomments": 580.0, "numweights": 88.0, "averageweight": 2.6591, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 667}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 353}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "143519", "name": "Quantum", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bgle3gjd2wTrD31ps_z92w__thumb/img/bjSkZpezCxJBqtucXslJAX2laKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1727619.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bgle3gjd2wTrD31ps_z92w__original/img/kUKMz0IfUvlqwtGO7FcPrlJHZdc=/0x0/pic1727619.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Dice", "Fighting", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Square Grid"], "designers": ["Eric Zimmerman"], "artists": ["Georges Bouchelaghem", "Kieran Yanner"], "publishers": ["Funforge", "Asterion Press", "Gen-X Games", "Passport Game Studios"], "description": "Send out the scouts! Position the Flagship in tactical orbit! And reconfigure that Battlestation into something new! Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.\n\nIn Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.\n\nEach type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.\n\nYou win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors.

Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.\n\nPlayers simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing \u2013 and you're not required to do either \u2013 take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.\n\nOne by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep \u2013 the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table then anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep \"bonus\" and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.\n\nReset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round. The player with the highest score after five rounds wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "132580", "name": "Pictomania: Geek Edition"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 25, "minplaytime": 25, "maxplaytime": 25, "minage": 9, "stats": {"usersrated": 3175, "average": 7.2909, "bayesaverage": 6.7076, "stddev": 1.29521, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4623, "trading": 141, "wanting": 137, "wishing": 814, "numcomments": 568, "numweights": 106, "averageweight": 1.5283, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 701}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 28}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 42, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "4": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 24, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 18, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "6": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 12}}}, "usersrated": 3175.0, "average": 7.2909, "bayesaverage": 6.7076, "stddev": 1.29521, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4623.0, "trading": 141.0, "wanting": 137.0, "wishing": 814.0, "numcomments": 568.0, "numweights": 106.0, "averageweight": 1.5283, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 701}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 28}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "recommendations": "SUSD"}, {"id": "276025", "name": "Maracaibo", "alternative_names": ["\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0439\u0431\u043e", "\u30de\u30e9\u30ab\u30a4\u30dc", "\u9a6c\u62c9\u5f00\u6ce2", "\ub9c8\ub77c\uce74\uc774\ubcf4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMNa0k05zMdKgSEp26Q3Tw__thumb/img/lVlnhYyxlZb3WuKZJHLoJcFHEjs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4917407.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMNa0k05zMdKgSEp26Q3Tw__original/img/qP99uYh6kOi_erZTgkYDe_AVSsw=/0x0/pic4917407.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: Maracaibo (Venezuela)", "Components: Control Boards", "Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Components: Multi-Use Cards", "Country: Venezuela", "Game: Maracaibo", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Region: Caribbean Sea", "Theme: Colonial"], "categories": ["Economic", "Exploration"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Contracts", "End Game Bonuses", "Events", "Hand Management", "Income", "Legacy Game", "Movement Points", "Narrative Choice / Paragraph", "Point to Point Movement", "Race", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Stock Holding", "Sudden Death Ending", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks", "Track Movement", "Variable Setup"], "designers": ["Alexander Pfister"], "artists": ["Fiore GmbH", "Aline Kirrmann"], "publishers": ["Game's Up", "BoardM Factory", "Capstone Games", "dlp games", "Ediciones MasQueOca", "Fishbone Games", "Hobby World", "MeepleBR", "Super Meeple", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)", "uplay.it edizioni", "YOKA Games"], "description": "Maracaibo, the new strategy game for 1-4 players by Alexander Pfister, is set in the Caribbean during the 17th century.

Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth.
