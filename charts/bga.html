But simply reaching the boat does not mean they have escaped as re-capture is always possible, perhaps, even likely. They will not be really safe until they reach their Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.\nEach player leads a group of pirates to Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.The path leads the pirates through wild jungle and across the waters of open ocean to the island of Tortuga. In addition to the innate perils of the trip are the other pirates, as each group wants to be the first to arrive at Pirate's Nest and will do what they can to slow the others' progress. As soon as one player has all his pirates in Pirate's Nest, he can raise the Jolly Roger and win the game.\n\nThe game is a sequel to Cartagena with the pirates trying to figure out what to do now that they have escaped from the prison.\n\nInside the box:\n\n    5 game board pieces with 7 symbols: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass\n    3 Game board parts: boat, Pirate's Nest and Jolly Roger flag\n    105 cards - 15 cards of each symbol: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass plus 1 of each symbol with gold border\n    30 pirate figures 6 each of five colors\n\n\nEach player receives seven cards. A turn consists of taking at least one and up to three of the following actions:\n1) Play a card and move a pirate forward to the next unoccupied matching symbol.\n2) Move an opponent\u2019s pirate forward to the next space with one or two pirates on it (you may not skip over pirates), then draw one card for each pirate already there (max. 3 pirates on any one space at the same time).\n3) Sail the boat between the islands.\n\nTo sail the boat to the second island, you must have at least one pirate in the boat. If, at the start of your turn, your pirates outnumber the pirates of your opponent/s, you may sail the boat as a free action. You can only move the boat back to the first island if you still have at least one pirate on the first island.\n\nThere is no hand limit, but if a player plays a card with a yellow border, all players must discard down to 7 cards.\n\nThe winner is the first player to move all his pirates into the Pirate's Nest and raise the flag.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2006.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 45.0, "minplaytime": 45.0, "maxplaytime": 45.0, "minage": 8.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 924, 'average': 6.47748, 'bayesaverage': 5.82843, 'stddev': 1.2156, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1325, 'trading': 53, 'wanting': 36, 'wishing': 139, 'numcomments': 306, 'numweights': 89, 'averageweight': 1.5618, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3752}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 1079}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 13, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 9}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '3': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 6, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 8, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 9}}}", "usersrated": 924.0, "average": 6.47748, "bayesaverage": 5.82843, "stddev": 1.2156, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1325.0, "trading": 53.0, "wanting": 36.0, "wishing": 139.0, "numcomments": 306.0, "numweights": 89.0, "averageweight": 1.5618, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3752}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 1079}]", "game_family": "Cartagena", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 98778, "name": "Bailout!

Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nZero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.\n\nAs with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.\n\nBoth Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.\n\nAre you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might? Or will the Allies, in their outdated machines, halt the Japanese onslaught much earlier?\n\nCONTENTS:    \n\n     88 full-color, die-cut counters.\n     150 full-color Playing Cards\n     6 Campaign Map Displays\n     One Bombing Display\n     One Resource Sheet\n     One 16-page Rulebook\n     One 20-page Campaign Booklet\n     8 Target Displays\n     Three Campaign Logs \n\n\nDesigned by Dan Verssen\nDeveloped by Mike Lemick\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '327895', 'name': 'Battle of the Bismarck Sea'}, {'id': '6506', 'name': 'Corsairs and Hellcats'}, {'id': '25559', 'name': 'Down in Flames Squadron Pack 2: Bombers'}, {'id': '159661', 'name': 'Down in Flames: Dutch Harbor / Aleutians'}, {'id': '126921', 'name': 'Down in Flames: Operation Leader 1943'}, {'id': '38210', 'name': 'Down in Flames: The Netherlands East Indies'}, {'id': '42711', 'name': 'Khalkin-Gol: 1939'}, {'id': '38211', 'name': 'Zero!: Java \u2013 Module'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2001.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 10.0, "playingtime": 60.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 60.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 598, 'average': 6.93375, 'bayesaverage': 5.84507, 'stddev': 1.35327, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1314, 'trading': 71, 'wanting': 19, 'wishing': 72, 'numcomments': 269, 'numweights': 69, 'averageweight': 2.2899, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3621}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 440}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 9, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '2': {'best_rating': 7, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '4': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 4}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '7': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 5}, '8': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '9': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 5}, '10': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '10+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 5}}}", "usersrated": 598.0, "average": 6.93375, "bayesaverage": 5.84507, "stddev": 1.35327, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1314.0, "trading": 71.0, "wanting": 19.0, "wishing": 72.0, "numcomments": 269.0, "numweights": 69.0, "averageweight": 2.2899, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3621}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 440}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 42215, "name": "Treasury of Word Games", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tcdOyX2FbQ-9R512C3hYew__thumb/img/0hVI4d4IEfGPDRgbxZF2MY-Aj1M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic474276.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tcdOyX2FbQ-9R512C3hYew__original/img/GoceauDp6Nq_zc-SYR0kL3yPFjI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic474276.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Card Game', \"Children's Game\", 'Word Game']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "['(Uncredited)']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['Waddingtons']", "description": "This has a large collection of components used to play 15 different card games.

Each child gets a colored shoe as well as a matching shoelace. The shoe has holes which have colored edges. Now, the color die comes into play.

If it\u2019s a different color, then he has to look carefully: If red was rolled and a free hole is also red, then he gets to thread the lace. If, however, none of the next holes are red, then he gets to give away the color by choosing an opponent who needs the color and can use it to continue threading his lace. As soon as a child has succeeded in completely threading his shoelace, he wins the game. If he can then also tie a knot, he\u2019s laughing.

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '98989', 'name': 'BGO Extended 2.0 expansion (fan expansion for Through the Ages)'}, {'id': '98607', 'name': 'Cywilizacja: Poprzez wieki \u2013 Polski dodatek 1'},

These ships act as action spaces that players use to gather resources, explore the nearby planets, and build their stations. Turns are fast and straightforward; either take ship action or take income.\n\nMany games start players off with a small resource engine which they build up to a bigger one. In Space Station Phoenix, players start with the best production engine they will ever have and proceed to break it down part by part. As the game progresses, their actions get more efficient, but the number of ways to take those actions starts to diminish.\n\nSpace Station Phoenix also features deep re-playability with millions of possible starting positions and station parts combinations.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2022.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 120.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 120.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 715, 'average': 7.45724, 'bayesaverage': 6.05917, 'stddev': 1.3849, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 940, 'trading': 18, 'wanting': 204, 'wishing': 1052, 'numcomments': 180, 'numweights': 30, 'averageweight': 2.9333, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2395}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1069}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 31, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 12}, '2': {'best_rating': 10, 'recommended_rating': 11, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '3': {'best_rating': 15, 'recommended_rating': 11, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '4': {'best_rating': 8, 'recommended_rating': 8, 'not_recommended_rating': 11}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 14}}}", "usersrated": 715.0, "average": 7.45724, "bayesaverage": 6.05917, "stddev": 1.3849, "median": 0.0, "owned": 940.0, "trading": 18.0, "wanting": 204.0, "wishing": 1052.0, "numcomments": 180.0, "numweights": 30.0, "averageweight": 2.9333, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2395}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1069}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 364343, "name": "\u9b54\u5973\u306e\u4e00\u6483\u5b85\u914d\u4fbf (Witch's Shot Delivery Service)", "alternative_names": "['Majo No Ichigeki Takuhaibin']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mY6ScICeTUNkwfpugTmtOg__thumb/img/mFhlJn24RQfmOIpvQEEd3jUcLh8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6900146.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mY6ScICeTUNkwfpugTmtOg__original/img/y-6Q6sGQgpjOZwRqiOxjfVNLXqo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6900146.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Card Game']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Trick-taking']", "designers": "['Neko Yanagi (\u732b\u67f3\u751f)']", "artists": "['Tasuke (\u305f\u4ecb)']", "publishers": "['Nekoyanagi Daikinsei (\u732b\u67f3\u5927\u91d1\u661f)']", "description": "In \u00e9\u00ad\u201d\u00e5\u00a5\u00b3\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e4\u00b8\u20ac\u00e6\u2019\u0192\u00e5\u00ae\u2026\u00e9\u2026\u008d\u00e4\u00be\u00bf (Majo No Ichigeki Takuhaibin, or Witch's Shot Delivery Service), players work for a...hypothetical courier delivery service, \"amajon\".

The Game begins shortly after Charles IV of France dies in 1328. The Queen of England, Isabella of France, is unable to claim the French throne for herself, and has claimed it for her son, Edward III. France rejects the claim, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right that she did not possess. The Player represents the House of Plantagenet with the ambition of attaining control of France. As the Commander of English Forces, you must control a significant number of French Cities and Towns before the last Campaign Card is played.\n\nGAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the English Forces. The Player\u2019s Objective is to attempt to control at least 10 French Cities and 12 French Towns before the last Campaign Card is Played. If the French control London and Portsmouth at the end of their Turn, the French win. If the last Campaign Card was played and Player does not control 10 Cities and 12 Towns, France Wins.\n\nGAME FEATURES: NO KING OF ENGLAND features lots of colorful game counters of various Combat Units including Nobles, Knights, Archers, Handgunners and Cannon. English Nobles will gather their Forces and move on the Map in a strategic manner along rout lines of key settlements (and Naval Lanes).

The question quickly arose; which topic, era, theater etc. should our second volume cover? We wanted something limited in scope, but that would offer a good number of ping-pong table sized battles. We also prefer to do subjects that have not been yet covered in miniatures. Island War came immediately to mind. The battles of the Pacific islands would certainly provide the proper size actions and only a game of Great Battles scope could cover the forces and time scales needed. Finally, we could include a Canadian action (Hong Kong) - always a bonus in our view. There was also German operations in Poland, France and the Mediterranean. Finally, of course there was the whole Eastern Front to choose from. We felt, however, that we should experiment more with the system before we wrote the definitive scenario book for WWII miniatures gamers - the Steppes of Russia.\n\nI think it was Marcel Van der Sleen who first floated the idea that Great Battles was the perfect vehicle to present airborne actions. He had done a fair bit of work on Operation Market Garden and insisted that Great Battle's scope and time scale could be worked into three or four linked scenarios leading to a grand-campaign that would reflect the whole operation. In addition, Marcel claimed that very few adjustments would be needed. The movement, combat and morale would be left unchanged. We had already worked with the basic organizations in Canadians in Europe. He was correct. Great Battles remained unchanged, throughout the project. The only differences were the additions of landing rules and the use of activation cards instead of a set number of activation points.\n\nOnce into the research, I found that not only did the airborne operations offer interesting scenarios, but there was \"a little bit for everyone\". There are air-drops of course but also tank-to-tank confrontations, elite units, militia units, street fighting, battalion operations, division operation and even corps operations. In addition, the Operations Mercury (Crete) and Operation Market Garden (Holland) could be linked into a grand campaign using defined battlefields (ping-pong tables) but allowing for area-to-area movement between tables - a rarity in miniatures gaming.\n\nUltimately, we feel that Drop Zone offers a different type of miniatures scenarios. Those that have played Canadians in Europe will immediately notice the difference, in texture, between the set-piece co-ordinated attack-defend actions and the tenuous, nail-biting to-and-fro of an airborne operation. For those who have not played the other scenarios in this series, be prepared for a new gaming experience. Your games will not simulate a 40 minute fight for the local farmhouse or crossroads. Instead, you will have to plan a multi-day operation - to land parachute brigades or even divisions behind enemy lines and then relieve them. Great Battles puts you in the general's chair where deployment and activation of forces, weather, supply, recovery and reinforcements artillery and air support are more important than the penetrating power of a shell or the armor thickness of a turret.\n\nWe are quite proud of Drop Zone and very pleased that Great Battles has made the transition to this new topic with such ease. We look forward to exploring other eras and theaters with Great Battles of World War II.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1997.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 6.0,

In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.\n\nPlayers have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.\n\nPlayers are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2000.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 45.0, "minplaytime": 45.0, "maxplaytime": 45.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1619, 'average': 6.47599, 'bayesaverage': 5.94777, 'stddev': 1.22185, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1982, 'trading': 145, 'wanting': 39, 'wishing': 135, 'numcomments': 595, 'numweights': 149, 'averageweight': 2.5503, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2935}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1325}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 29, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 10}, '2': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 10}, '3': {'best_rating': 9, 'recommended_rating': 12, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 12, 'recommended_rating': 9, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 10, 'not_recommended_rating': 6}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 11}}}", "usersrated": 1619.0, "average": 6.47599, "bayesaverage": 5.94777, "stddev": 1.22185, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1982.0, "trading": 145.0, "wanting": 39.0, "wishing": 135.0, "numcomments": 595.0, "numweights": 149.0, "averageweight": 2.5503, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2935}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1325}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "bga": true}, {"id": 251247, "name": "Wyrd Chronicles (Issue 35 - Apr 2018)", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/auXqcvWfy03d6a478rlklQ__thumb/img/xif-wf8uG3z2BaAFp0vTxGTFBsM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4088292.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/auXqcvWfy03d6a478rlklQ__original/img/xsOaLa4GTPEBE_oo2IS8GVvFmCM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4088292.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "From publisher blurb:\n\nWyrd Chronicles Vol. 35, now with more rattling!\n\n    Starting Malifaux on a Budget \u2013 Resurrectionists: Looking to build an inexpensive Resurrectionist crew but don\u2019t know where to start?

In what became known as the Winter War, ferocious Finnish resistance soon shocked the world and inflicted repeated defeats on the invaders.\n\nThe Soviet plan included attacks in the dark forests of Eastern Karelia, attempting to outflank the stout line of Finnish fortifications to the south. Their 139th Rifle Division advanced in early December 1939 along the river Aittijoki, faced by only a handful of Finnish battalions. The Finns panicked in some places, and a near-rout seemed inevitable. Finnish Marshal Carl Gustav Mannerheim sent a small group of reinforcements led by Col. Paavo Talvela, previously in charge of buying artillery ammunition for the army.\n\nTalvela proved that a warrior lived within the bureaucrat, as he put new heart into his men and stemming the Soviet advance. After heavy fighting, the Finns had destroyed the 139th Rifle Division and routed the 75th Rifle Division. But they suffered serious losses as well, as the Soviets here had committed ski troops of their own including the \u201cRed Finns\u201d seldom mentioned by Finnish writers.\n\nWinter Fury re-creates the twin battles of Tolvaj\u00e4rvi and Ilomantsi from 1939, as well as the 1941 Finnish offensive over the same ground. It uses a \u201cvariable impulse\u201d game system to model the two armies\u2019 very different capabilities. Each turn, each player puts a number of markers into a common container. These are then drawn one by one, the number drawn varying with the current weather condition. The Finnish player has weaker forces, but will usually draw more markers and these allow the Finns to conduct more operations. The good Finnish units are better than the Soviet ones, and more mobile in the forests. The Soviet cannot move his or her divisions together, complicating the Red Army\u2019s efforts. But Soviet artillery is very powerful while Finnish guns are little more than a nuisance. The Soviet player also has tanks and armored cars, which not only are powerful in battle (at least on the roads), they also might cause the Finns to panic and run away.\n\nWinter Fury is the second in our line of Playbooks: a 64-page book about the battle and the forces involved that also includes a complete historical game on the subject. The book includes a lengthy background piece by David Lippman as well as rules, scenarios and other historical data. There are 280 playing pieces and a 34x22-inch map.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2001.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 360.0, "minplaytime": 360.0, "maxplaytime": 360.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 65, 'average': 6.00154, 'bayesaverage': 5.51313, 'stddev': 1.46421, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 355, 'trading': 13, 'wanting': 4, 'wishing': 20, 'numcomments': 55, 'numweights': 15, 'averageweight': 2.7333, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 16777}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 3183}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 8, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 4}}}", "usersrated": 65.0, "average": 6.00154, "bayesaverage": 5.51313, "stddev": 1.46421, "median": 0.0, "owned": 355.0, "trading": 13.0, "wanting": 4.0, "wishing": 20.0, "numcomments": 55.0, "numweights": 15.0, "averageweight": 2.7333, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 16777}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 3183}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 296044, "name": "Woad Hag", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0gy4HpWRXuQb7t80HRsUsg__thumb/img/MbFy8IoGZU69qjf2aG5krJ7ZC80=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5102508.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0gy4HpWRXuQb7t80HRsUsg__original/img/RaPl25c6kjn9cF-R0FUOsYSiMkw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5102508.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "From publisher blurb:\n\nFurtive whispers behind closed doors spread rumors of supernatural forces which control the actions of the aristocracy.

Another scoring deck of 24 has values of 1-12; two cards from this deck are laid face up.\n\nPlayers choose one card from their hand in secret and reveal them simultaneously. The highest value played takes the lowest scoring card, which goes face-up to a pile in front of you. The second highest takes the other card likewise. Remaining cards are discounted. Then look at everyone's face-up deck: the highest scoring player turns one of his or her marker cards over! (The original game had cockatoos becoming cuckoos; this edition is themed on lifesavers). At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers).\n\nThere is a further twist!

The game board depicts the monopolies found in the original game, with the property groups color-coded as in Monopoly. Each property group has a given dollar value, which you can collect by rolling the dice and collecting that group.\n\nOn a turn, you roll ten dice, set aside any die reading \"Go,\" \"to\" or \"jail\", then set aside any color group dice that you wish. If the \"Go,\" \"to\" and \"jail\" dice are set aside, your turn ends immediately, and you score nothing. Otherwise you can choose to either (1) stop and score for what you've rolled or (2) roll again with any dice not set aside, once again setting aside the \"Go,\" \"to\" or \"jail\" dice, etc. The dice have a couple of \"Wild\" faces, and you can use at most one Wild in a color group. (If you roll the proper color, you can replace a Wild die in a group and roll that die again on a later turn.)\n\nIf you stop, you score for all completed color groups and one incomplete color group. Your goal is to be the first player to reach a predetermined dollar amount or to have the most money at the end of a pre-set number of turns.\n\nMonopoly Express \u2013 an updated version of this game that was first released in the UK and Europe, then later in the U.S. \u2013 alters the gameplay as follows:\n\n\n     The policeman from the \"Go To Jail\" corner of the board game replaces the words \"Go,\" \"to\" and \"jail\".\n     One blank face on one of the policeman dice depicts a green \"GO\" arrow. A player earns $200 each time they roll GO, but they lose this money if they bust due to policemen. \n     The game includes an eleventh \"House/Hotel\" die that can earn (or lose) a player Houses (worth $1,000 each), earn Hotels (worth $5,000, but only if a player has already earned four houses) and a \"Get Out Of Jail Free\" side that negates a policeman (including a policeman that would bust a player). This die cannot be rolled until a player completes a property group (i.e., neither railroads nor utilities).\n     The Wild faces are replaced by the Chance \"?\" logo; the ? act as a Wild, but unlike a Wild it cannot be replaced.\n     The first player to have at least $15,000 wins immediately; players don't complete the round.\n\n\nIn 2021, this game was re-released in the US as Monopoly DICED! with square packaging rather than the round used for Express.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1991.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 20.0, "minplaytime": 20.0, "maxplaytime": 20.0, "minage": 8.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 914, 'average': 5.67027, 'bayesaverage': 5.55356, 'stddev': 1.35467, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1919, 'trading': 92, 'wanting': 12, 'wishing': 46, 'numcomments': 412, 'numweights': 94, 'averageweight': 1.1383, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10505}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 2022}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 11, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 5}, '2': {'best_rating': 8, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}}}", "usersrated": 914.0, "average": 5.67027, "bayesaverage": 5.55356, "stddev": 1.35467, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1919.0, "trading": 92.0, "wanting": 12.0, "wishing": 46.0, "numcomments": 412.0, "numweights": 94.0, "averageweight": 1.1383, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10505}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 2022}]", "game_family": "Monopoly (Official)", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 1465, "name": "Venezia", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TgOy_1XA7jGygxYgHRH_1w__thumb/img/WZf6TpcSDZL0eQSOXRYCy0ja1gQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic639428.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TgOy_1XA7jGygxYgHRH_1w__original/img/Wo5NlD8cvl4hjOS9m6CovU9vX9k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic639428.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Animals: Pigeons', 'Cities: Venice (Veneto, Italy)', 'Country: Italy']", "categories": "['Card Game', 'Travel']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Area Majority / Influence', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']", "designers": "['Ronald Hofst\u00e4tter']", "artists": "['Elena Oberm\u00fcller']", "publishers": "['Queen Games']", "description": "As pigeon clans, players vie for roosting rights in the districts of Venice.

Seth's Tunnels serve as shelters for Orcs, Goblins, Cultists, Necromancers, the Living Dead and the terrible Svartalfenheim (The Black Elves), as well as the Scorpion People and other even more terrifying creatures.\nDungeons can be ancient abandoned mausoleums, ancient crypts of lost dynasties, subterranean labyrinths built by already extinct races, dens or orches and caches of orcs, gnolls or goblins, serving as the basis for powerful necromantics or even demonic portals for other dimensions. All of these sites have legends about lost treasures and valuable artifacts and attract the attention of Kingdom Adventurers groups.\nOur game begins when a group of Four Brave Heroes decides to investigate these locations in their quest during Hero's Journey.\nThe RPGQuest can be played from 2 to 5 people (or up to 6 people if one of them takes the role of Narrator). Each of them will take on the role of one or more Heroes (out of 12 initials) within a team of 4 Adventurers and together they must face the challenges within the Dungeons.\n\nRPGQuest is played in stages, called ADVENTURES. During an Adventure, a Hero can find or gain treasures and valuable artifacts. Weapons, Armor, and Magic Items that can be used in the following Adventures of a Campaign. You can also improve the powers and attributes of your Characters by making them stronger and more powerful on your Journey.\nHeroes must act together to win the Adventures.

But it\u2019s no simple task!\n\nEach player in Museum has a small collection of relics to get them started, after which, they will have to send explorers around the world to uncover others. These relics each have a value which is either the cost to add them to your museum, or how much they contribute towards adding other relics to your museum. \u201cSpent\u201d Relics are added to your reserve. You can withdraw them from it by exchanging them for an equal number of items; however, your opponents also has access to your reserve!\n\nDuring the game you will be required to assemble different collections.

Dinosaurs! But you fear nobody is going to believe you. That's why you need to take photos of them.\n\nExplore the island, take many photos but beware, dinosaurs are not used to visitors. Some will flee but other may find you tasty! You will not be able to show your photos when you're eaten. Also remember that it's not the quantity of photos that count but quality. Big and dangerous dinosaurs are worth more points than small, easier to find ones.\n\nLet the Dino Safari begin!\n\nDuring setup players are required to create the \"island\" using tiles with hexagonal spaces starting with \"camp\" tile. Once it's done 12 randomly chosen dinosaur tokens are randomly placed on \"nest\" spaces facing down. Then each player choose their character and place him/her in the camp. Players take their turns clockwise. During player's turn you have three movement points and one \"take a picture\" action. You can spend those in any order you want. Characters can move in any direction they want, \"plains\" space costs 1 movement point while \"forest\" space costs 2. You cannot enter \"crags\" or \"lake\" spaces. To take a photo move to a space adjacent to dinosaur token and uncover it then take the card with species you've uncovered. On each species card you can see how much points it's worth and its skills like movement points and special rules. Players can also take pictures of already uncovered dinos to get their cards but you can score only once for each species. Starting with round two after you're done with your character's actions you can move 1 uncovered dinosaur token (you must be in possession of that species card). You can use that to run away from other players, scare off another uncovered dinosaur to remove its token so nobody can take a picture of it anymore or, if it's a carnivore, attack other players. Attacked player loses one life and is forced to return to camp. If a character is attacked third time (losing last remaining life) he/she is considered \"eaten\" and eliminated from game (his/her score is 0 no matter how many cards were in his/her possession).

These cards are your collection.\n\n2: Using your collection, build an active deck made of least, lesser, and greater portents.\n\n3: Your hand is drawn from your active deck, but if you don't like your hand, you can discard cards to power seals, a limited resource that reduces the random nature of cards by giving you a number of deterministic \"outs\" per day.\n\nProduct Features\n\n    The cartomancer base class with four archetypes: ace, dealer, shyster, and wildcard\n    Two cartomancy decks: classic and deathdealer, each with their own overarching themes and combos\n    The Multitudes of Fate feat, which allows for selected cards from a special, third deck to be added to the player's repertoire\n    Print-and-play classic, deathdealer, and multitudes decks, complete with rules help\n    Equivalence tables that allow for the use of poker cards if the print-and-play cards are unavailable (But use them, please!)\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2018.0, "minplayers": null, "maxplayers": null, "playingtime": null, "minplaytime": null, "maxplaytime": null, "minage": null, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '16', 'name': 'rpgitem', 'friendlyname': 'RPG Item Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '16', 'name': 'rpgitem', 'friendlyname': 'RPG Item Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": null, "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 283948, "name": "Vacuumania", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "Guide Victor around the corridors vacuuming the carpet, avoid angry brooms and suck up the litter for bonus points.\n\n(instructions)\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": null, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 0.0, "playingtime": null, "minplaytime": null, "maxplaytime": null, "minage": null, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '32', 'name': 'videogame', 'friendlyname': 'Video Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '5134', 'name': 'msx', 'friendlyname': 'MSX Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '32', 'name': 'videogame', 'friendlyname': 'Video Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '5134', 'name': 'msx', 'friendlyname': 'MSX Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": null, "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 245643, "name": "Infected: The Carrier", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dVMuZ6li1TIigPLh5fLeHA__thumb/img/Gq4H86Ce9UibOpZPzS20Nf7eR7E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3970511.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dVMuZ6li1TIigPLh5fLeHA__original/img/KBHGqiOF7CunWAh3p7NV-0Li5Po=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3970511.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": "['Components: Miniatures']", "categories": "['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Expansion for Base-game', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'Spies/Secret Agents']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Cooperative Game']", "designers": "['Bryan Sloan']", "artists": "['Artur Jag', 'Josh T.

Each player also holds a pack of 9 yellow cards. one '+5', one '+3' one '+2' three '+1's, a spare wheel, a food musette (musette = In cycling, a bag containing food handed out in a feed zone of a multi-stage race such as the Tour de France) , and a 'Baraka'. (which means good luck in French slang.) On their turn the active player draws a random card for each of their racers, and if desired adds one of their yellow cards. Yellow cards are discarded for the stage after play. \nIf a racer ends his move with one space between him and the player of his team ahead of him, then he can slip-stream into the space provided it is not filled by racers of other teams. A racer can also slipstream another team's racer if there is a completely empty road space between them. Roads are 4, 3 or two riders wide, depending upon the terrain.\nThe winner can be decided by shortest number of turns taken to complete the course, or by placing in the finishing order of each stage - (better to agree this in advance). The short stages can take between 30 and 60 minutes, and the long stages 60 to 90. A lot depends upon the number of players, and of racers per team. If the whole race is to be run is would be best to spell it over a weekend with some other games filling between stages.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1994.0,

A different kind of post-apocalyptic world, one in which civilization fell quietly by laziness, is portrayed in The Industrial Complex. Finally, M.

As in xiangqi, it is played on the vertices of the grid. The board is divided into two lang territories by a river in the middle of the board. The three files on one side of the board form the sea. The object of the game is to capture the opponent's Commander, or all units of a single division of the opponent's army.\n\nThe pieces on both sides, with their abbreviations, movements, and rules, are:\n\n\n     1 Commander (C): moves any distance orthogonally; captures 1 point orthogonally; may occupy Headquarters; may not \"see\" the opposing Commander on an open file\n     2 Infantry (I): 1 point orthogonally\n     2 Tanks (T): 2 points orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter, remaining stationary; carries C, In, or M\n     1 Militia (M): 1 point orthogonally\n     2 Engineer (E): 1 point orthogonally; carries all pieces, only across river; controls airspace 1 point any direction\n     2 Artillery (A): 1\u20133 points any direction; crosses river only at reefs, by attacking, or carried\n     2 Anti-aircraft gun (AA): 1 point orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter; controls airspace 1 point any direction\n     1 Missile Rocket (R): 1\u20132 points orthogonally or 1 point diagonally; controls airspace as it moves\n     2 Air force (AF): 1\u20134 points any direction; may return to its departing point after capturing or carrying, unless capturing opposing Af; carries C, In, or M; destroyed immediately on passing through opposing airspace\n     2 Navy (N): 1-4 points any direction on sea, sea banks, and river banks; captures as it moves at sea; shoots 1\u20133 in any direction at land targets; controls airspace 1 point any direction\n     2 Commander Base (B): stationary and does not capture; may house only C; protects C, but not itself, from In, M, Aa, and Ms\n\n\nGeneral rules:\n\n     Pieces capture as they move, and never jump, unless noted.\n     Pieces can cross the river but not occupy sea points unless noted.\n     Pieces which check the opposing Commander are promoted, gaining special abilities.\n\n\nThe Chinese xiangqi has generally been the most popular form of chess played in Vietnam. In fact, there is no traditional distinctively-Vietnamese chess game; which is partly what inspired C\u00e1\u00bb\u009d t\u00c6\u00b0 l\u00e1\u00bb\u2021nh.\n\nC\u00e1\u00bb\u009d t\u00c6\u00b0 l\u00e1\u00bb\u2021nh is played on the vertices of an 11x12 \"geographic\" board similar to the 9x10 xiangqi board, with the addition of an ocean occupying files A\u2013C and two \"reefs\" allowing all pieces to ford the river. It shares many features with wargames, including area denial, ranged attack, and unit cooperation.\n\nBesides the fact that Vietnam has never had a distinctive regional form of chess, Nguy\u00e1\u00bb\u2026n noted four complaints with xiangqi influenced the creation of C\u00e1\u00bb\u009d t\u00c6\u00b0 l\u00e1\u00bb\u2021nh:\n\n1. Xiangqi promotes individualism and class conflict, particularly in the willingness of players to sacrifice low-level pieces to succeed.\n2. Winning xiangqi is due more to luck than to intellect.\n3. Xiangqi does not reflect the geography and history of Vietnam.\n4. Xiangqi has many rule variantions, none of which are accepted by the entire community.\n\nEach of these points is answered in C\u00e1\u00bb\u009d t\u00c6\u00b0 l\u00e1\u00bb\u2021nh:\n\n1. Pieces cooperate through a \"carrying\" and area denial mechanics. As well, losing an entire class of piece loses the game, forcing protection of and cooperation among all classes.\n2. Nguy\u00e1\u00bb\u2026n believes the interactions between pieces and influence of geography necessitate more strategy and reduce the role of luck.\n3. Besides the single river of xiangqi, there is an ocean, as well as \"reefs\" across the river, all of which interact with special piece rules. Besides the Vietnam-like geography, the pieces modern rather than ancient military structure.\n4.

There are several thousand discrete items that can be found through adventuring or purchased with \"meat,\" the in-game currency -- from the lowly snorkel to the mighty plexiglass pith helmet, from a handful of white chocolate chips to the ominous spooky hi mein.  Players are allotted a number of turns to spend each day, and can earn more each day by eating and drinking certain things.  There is a robust crafting system for foods, booze, armor, weapons, jewelry, and \"miscellaneous\" (think \"wumpus hair shirt\"), and more than a hundred skills to collect each time the player completes the quest, ascends, and begins again.  The game allows a variety of play styles, from casual to \"hardcore\" to \"Bad Moon,\" each with its own restrictions, challenges, and in-game leaderboard showing fastest runs.\n\nThere is an active chat system with multiple channels, a simple-but-popular PvP system, clans and clan-specific content , an in-game mall supporting a vibrant in-game economy, active community forums (including a real-life convention held annually in Arizona), and new content and items being introduced monthly by the developers.\n\nBest of all, it is entirely free to play.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": null, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 0.0, "playingtime": null, "minplaytime": null, "maxplaytime": null, "minage": null, "stats": "{'usersrated': 107, 'average': 7.96636, 'bayesaverage': 6.32118, 'stddev': 2.07057, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 66, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 1, 'numcomments': 26, 'numweights': 20, 'averageweight': 3.65, 'ranks': [{'id': '32', 'name': 'videogame', 'friendlyname': 'Video Game Rank', 'value': 1544}, {'id': '5084', 'name': 'webbrowser', 'friendlyname': 'Web Browser Rank', 'value': 43}]}", "suggested_players": "{}", "usersrated": 107.0, "average": 7.96636, "bayesaverage": 6.32118, "stddev": 2.07057, "median": 0.0, "owned": 66.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 1.0, "numcomments": 26.0, "numweights": 20.0, "averageweight": 3.65, "ranks": "[{'id': '32', 'name': 'videogame', 'friendlyname': 'Video Game Rank', 'value': 1544}, {'id': '5084', 'name': 'webbrowser', 'friendlyname': 'Web Browser Rank', 'value': 43}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": null, "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "bga": true}, {"id": 341510, "name": "Beneath the Well of Brass", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JzDNmraW05eLXwhr_4wlcg__thumb/img/Eb1il-78YXpIQiiFoxkXcnjVe_s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6254066.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JzDNmraW05eLXwhr_4wlcg__original/img/f-i0-GNxppayGsPyMI83Te5X36E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6254066.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "Publisher's description:\n\nFrom DCC Day 2021!

One set is black, one is white.  In four player game, everyone one grabs three random pieces and arranges them in numeric order, with white pieces going to the right on ties.  In order a player grabs one of the remaining tiles and guesses on of the opponents pieces.  If correct, that piece is revealed. If the player is incorrect the piece that was just drawn is placed in the correct place in his own sequence and revealed.  If the player was correct in guessing he MAY make another guess.  If he chooses not to then he places the picked piece in his code, in sequence, but does not reveal it.\n\nPlay continues until only one person has a piece standing.

They propose a game where they are the main characters. There will be two factions. Each faction will organize itself on one side of a chessboard. The number of the dice will be its strength, and it will change every time it's moved. The strong will eliminate the weak.\n\nAnd the battle starts at the cry of \"Alea non jacta est\"\n\n\nIn Artaban, each player controls seven 6-sided dice and a Leader Die (Which is just another 6-sided dice, but bigger than the other ones), for a total of 8 dice. The game starts with each player placing his dice on their second nearest row of the chessboard. (The face-up number of a die is its \"value\". At the start of the game, sum of the values on the 8 dice must be 28). The objective is to move the dice to their last line of the board. To achieve so, players alternate turns where they have four available options:\n\n1. Move a die left, right, or to the front by flipping the dice over (The top face ends being the left/right/front face respectively).\n2. Turn a dice 90\u00ba to the left or the right (without changing the topmost face).\n3. Capture an opposing die by placing a die (without turning/flipping it) on a square it could legally move to, but is occupied by an opposing die of less value (The Leader Die can capture dice of less and equal value, but can be captured just like any other die). [A variant allows dice to capture diagonally]\n4. Sacrifice a die by \"capturing\" an opposing die of the same value (Leader Die cannot be sacrificed). The opposing die is not retired (This helps speeding the game).\n\nOther Rules:\n-No two dice can occupy the same square at the same time.\n-A die cannot move back or diagonally (Except to capture an opposing die when using the variant).\n-The game ends when no player can move any dice OR a player proposes a tie and it's accepted by the other.\n\nAt the end of the game, the face-up value of all dice at their last line is counted, and the player with the bigger score is the winner. If there is a tie, the player with most dice on his last line is the winner. If there still is a tie, the player with most dice on the board is the winner. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 0.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 20.0, "minplaytime": 20.0, "maxplaytime": 20.0, "minage": 8.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1, 'average': 2.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 2, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 1, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 1, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 1.0, "average": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 1.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 184346, "name": "Bone Head", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2IMBz11icJB38_T6Ps5Dqg__thumb/img/l6hnypqsNGqHDzmRJ-Owp9COHPo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3607912.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2IMBz11icJB38_T6Ps5Dqg__original/img/y0jCTKLdBL7iQi3t7IYRbCbZ7os=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3607912.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Card Game']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "['John Grills']", "artists": "['John Grills']", "publishers": "['Zadorf']", "description": "Bone Head: the spooky little card game for 2-9 players.\n\nThe Bone Heads are on the hunt for roses!\n\nPlayers take turns to add their Bone Heads to a forming chain by linking hands and avoiding other Bone Heads with the same colour top hat.

The game system models the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) in some detail and this makes play of the game feel very different from other comparable games.  During this Operations Phase you can perform Maneuver/Fire, Fire Support, Engineering, Intelligence, in any order you desire to support your plans.  During the enemy player turn you have the opportunity to exercise the Air Defense OS, and during other times of the sequence of play you account for Command and Control and Combat Service Support.  There is a lot here to digest and if you want to get closest to being involved in a military Command Post Exercise, this is it.\n\nThis game is going to give you a completely new appreciation for the struggles of the Gross Deutschland Division during the Citadelle offensive.  The attacks timetable was disrupted early on and never got back on track.  The division hit the Pena River, bounced back, slid to the right along the southern bank, and then north toward Oboyan.  The sheer quantity of troops set against them is daunting to have to try and wear down.  But this is the nature of the battle.  And the game does a great job of presenting the situation as a real slugging match.\n\nGame Scales are:\n\n     Game Turns are 2 Hours of Daylight and 4 Hours of Night\n     Hex Scale is 330m per Hex\n     Red Army Units are Companies\n     German Units are Platoons and/or Companies\n\n\nGross Deutschland was the largest German division involved in the battle and was endowed with an abundance of armor.  Unfortunately it was armor (Panthers) that was still too young to work properly and caused everyone lots of headaches.  For this reason it is also the largest game in the series.  Gross Deutschland had the hardest mission as it moved through the center of the area of operations.  Its mission was to spearhead the XLVIII PzK operation and make the main effort up the Oboyan road towards Kursk.  The Division has components of all arms and is a very powerful organization, even without the Panther Battalions.  It is organized the same as an SS Division.

An Admiral could have COMMANDERS, in charge to manage the units (there could be a commander that handle all units, two commanders that share the army or specific commanders that handle a group or a type of units... depends on the number of players).\n\nTeams take turn by moving one unit at time (like in chess) orizontally or diagonally without change direction (planes can) and in case check if they hit a target.\nEach unit has three characteristics, Life points (1 to 3), speed (2 to 5 crosses) and range (0 to 3 crosses).

The first pawn to reach the opposite side wins.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1997.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 15.0, "minplaytime": 15.0, "maxplaytime": 15.0, "minage": 8.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 7317, 'average': 6.66462, 'bayesaverage': 6.38089, 'stddev': 1.3966, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 10870, 'trading': 339, 'wanting': 139, 'wishing': 1100, 'numcomments': 1658, 'numweights': 425, 'averageweight': 1.8588, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 1353}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': 107}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 138, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 89}, '2': {'best_rating': 116, 'recommended_rating': 14, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '3': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 13, 'not_recommended_rating': 79}, '4': {'best_rating': 22, 'recommended_rating': 55, 'not_recommended_rating': 37}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 84}}}", "usersrated": 7317.0, "average": 6.66462, "bayesaverage": 6.38089, "stddev": 1.3966, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10870.0, "trading": 339.0, "wanting": 139.0, "wishing": 1100.0, "numcomments": 1658.0, "numweights": 425.0, "averageweight": 1.8588, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 1353}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': 107}]", "game_family": "Blockade", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 681, "name": "Timbuktu", "alternative_names": "['Tombouctou']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dbmQFV3HGnvsew8-wOwPaw__thumb/img/2l9kHRNhNkyNgbjZmNRPbtIvUXk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic100711.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dbmQFV3HGnvsew8-wOwPaw__original/img/JZfk-Jmx1hAkb7nO_PhT9D8xPfg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic100711.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Animals: Camels', 'Continents: Africa', 'Country: Mali']", "categories": "['Deduction', 'Economic']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']", "designers": "['Dirk Henn']", "artists": "['Jo Hartwig']", "publishers": "['Queen Games', 'db-Spiele']", "description": "In this game each player takes the role of a caravan leader. The number of camels within a caravan depends on the number of players. Each camel is loaded with a lot of goods, and the goal of the game is to carry all the goods from the starting position to the final oasis: Timbuktu.\n\nHowever, during the course of this journey, the caravans stop at other oases. Once all camels arrive at an oasis, and night falls, thieves attack the caravan and steal different goods. While moving from one oasis to another, players receive different clues about the nature of the thefts. Each player has a different clue, and although clues are passed around, only one player receives three of the total five clues. From the actions of the other players (caravan leaders), the clues have to be guessed and camels have to be relocated, in order to save all the goods from the thieves.\n\nThe next morning, the caravan continues its way towards Timbuktu, and players are challenged with different clues again. The object of the game is to be the trader left with the most value in goods when they arrive at Timbuktu.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1993.0, "minplayers": 3.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 60.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 60.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1794, 'average': 6.65103, 'bayesaverage': 6.06852, 'stddev': 1.28885, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 2278, 'trading': 125, 'wanting': 103, 'wishing': 437, 'numcomments': 627, 'numweights': 229, 'averageweight': 2.786, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2356}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1129}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 25, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 12}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 12}, '3': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 13, 'not_recommended_rating': 4}, '4': {'best_rating': 8, 'recommended_rating': 13, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '5': {'best_rating': 15, 'recommended_rating': 6, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 9}}}", "usersrated": 1794.0, "average": 6.65103, "bayesaverage": 6.06852, "stddev": 1.28885, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2278.0, "trading": 125.0, "wanting": 103.0, "wishing": 437.0, "numcomments": 627.0, "numweights": 229.0, "averageweight": 2.786, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2356}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1129}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 354720, "name": "2070", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fkjTl3NiwhTWmwquoFfQNA__thumb/img/kcjUGfGNw3AdH-GOcQkti7LqvxA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6627119.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fkjTl3NiwhTWmwquoFfQNA__original/img/ISmjkSmGGjub6USJ-5dI-eorioM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6627119.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Upcoming Releases', 'Cities: Rome (Lazio, Italy)']", "categories": "['Adventure', 'Comic Book / Strip', 'Science Fiction']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Cooperative Game']", "designers": "['Emmanuel Quaireau']", "artists": "['Fabrizio Constantino']", "publishers": "['Blue Orange (EU)', 'Makaka Editions']", "description": "Victims of an attack, the plans of an unprecedented technology have been stolen from the powerful Solax laboratories. \nYou play as a group of elite agents: an android, a martial arts expert, an alien and a mercenary.

The object of the game is to run up your opponent\u2019s score, while completing your own round in as few strokes as possible.\n\nPar Fore the Course is an indoor game designed and developed by golf professionals to simulate the thrills and excitement of actual outdoor competition. As much as possible, Par Fore the Course is played the way real golf is played. But there\u2019s added excitement, because Par Fore the Course goes beyond the gentlemanly rules of the Royal and Ancient Game. In this competition, if you play a shot that lands you in trouble, your opponent does not stand back politely while you escape from your predicament. No! He gleefully drops you into a lot deeper trouble! And you do the same to him!\n\nTo start, cut the cards and the low card becomes the dealer and also plays first, play then follows clockwise. Once all first shots have been played, the player furthest from the hole plays. When two players are the same distance, the player arriving first plays. Once on the green, continue to putt until in the hole. Winner of each hole plays first on the next hole. In case of a tie, the player who played first on previous hole plays first for the next tee.\n\nBegin each hole by drawing up to 5 cards to your hand. To begin par 3\u2019s roll 2 dice and to begin par 4\u2019s and 5\u2019s roll 3 dice. The roll of the dice determines your ball's landing point and do the following based on the par of the hole and where it landed:\n\n\n     If on the fairway - play a card trying to match the suit of the position you landed. Whether it matches or not will determine what happens next (water, sand trap, out of control, make it to the green, etc)\n     If in a sand trap \u2014 roll 2 dice (and/or play a card). The number rolled is the distance you are from the hole, unless doubles are rolled. In that case, the result will depend on whether you have a matching numbered card in your hand.\n     If in the water \u2014 count one penalty stroke. Then, move your ball to a drop area on the board represented by a circled D. Any numbered card can be played to the green. The number on the card represents the distance from the hole.\n     If off the fairway \u2014 You are out of bounds and count a 2 stroke penalty and roll dice again.\n     If on the green \u2014 you can putt. The number of the card played to make it to the green determines the distance to the hole. Roll dice to see if you putt into the hole.\n     If the number cannot be found - You have a lost ball. Count 2 penalty strokes and roll dice again. (Note: A number is missing on each hole. The missing numbers are: Hole #1\u20149, #2\u201412, #3\u20145, #4\u201410, #5\u201412, #6\u201412, #7\u201415, #8\u201413, #9\u20149)\n\n\nOUT OF CONTROL: \n\n     Your ball is considered OUT OF CONTROL if you don't have a matching suit card for your numbered location OR number is off the fairway, but not in the water, a sand trap, or out of bounds. In this case, the player to your left plays a card and it determines what happens to your ball.\n\n\nHOLE IN ONE:\n\n     When a player rolls two 1\u2019s and holds the Ace of the suit shown in the middle of the green, they score a HOLE IN ONE!\n\n\nSCORING: Each time a player rolls the dice from the tee or on the green, count 1 point. Each time a card is played either by the player or his opponent, count 1. At the end of each hole add penalty shots incurred to your score. Lowest total after 9 holes wins. (Use far right of score pads to count each stroke.)\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 0.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 0.0, "minplaytime": 0.0,

The tentative treaty between the five clans has all but dissolved, and tensions are rising as the chaos of war approaches. Players enter the picture as potential leaders of a new era, and attempt to build a nation that will become the center of civilization. That nation can be warlike or peaceful.\n\nUnition is a deckbuilding combat free-for-all with two ways to win. Players have the choice of an aggressive approach where they reduce every other player\u2019s health to zero, or playing defensively and winning by points. Health and points are kept secret behind player screens, and so social dynamics play a part in overall strategy as the game goes on.\n\nEach player starts with a low-value starter deck from which they draw a hand of five cards to play on their turn. These played cards give resources like currency to recruit stronger clan cards, attack to direct at other players, and points to collect. Recruited clan cards bring new abilities and stronger elements into player's decks, and each clan has a specialty. Two cards of the same clan gain bonuses when played together, with a large bonus occurring if a member from each clan is played in a single hand.\n\nThe game ends in one of two ways: when only one player has health left, making them the last player standing, or when one player has gained 50 points. Each player starts with 50 health tokens, and when they reach zero, they are eliminated while other players continue. However, the instant any player gains their 50th point token, the game immediately ends for everyone and that player wins.\n\nUnition requires each player to carefully decide their path, balance resources, and build their empire while also playing the macro game of navigating the politics and subterfuge of those sitting around the table.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2023.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 150.0, "minplaytime": 90.0, "maxplaytime": 150.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 2, 'average': 9.19, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.81, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 2, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 1, 'wishing': 13, 'numcomments': 4, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 2.0, "average": 9.19, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.81, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 1.0, "wishing": 13.0, "numcomments": 4.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 347013, "name": "Legacy of Dust", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1AIaX4QTFgulSmztseI_7g__thumb/img/PLyrCv-YAPqNFOwkKr33IWiHALw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6390710.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1AIaX4QTFgulSmztseI_7g__original/img/USlJgZ0KXQmj9IuZAaL-fjkeLxk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6390710.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "From publisher:\n\nLegacy of Dust is a small postcard sized addition for The Singing Sands which allows the player to quickly create a character who has influenced the desert.

Some even claim they bring good luck to all who smoke them. But is there something more hideous lurking behind the emerald wisps of Reinhart smoke?\n\nEXTRA! \u201cSmoke Green\u201d is a short investigative scenario of Cthulhu Mythos horror, set entirely in H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s fictional town of Arkham. It is not a self-contained scenario, but rather an add-on to the newspaper-based resource, Dateline: Lovecraft, Issue #1. To make full use of this PDF you will need to own a copy of that product.\n\nWhen millionaire industrialist Reinhart Laine picked Arkham to be the site of his grand new Tobacco Rolling Factory, few could have predicted the rapid good fortune that his new \u201cReinhart Cigarettes\u201d would achieve. In a short time, not only were many Arkhamites smoking the new brand of cigarettes \u2014 distinguished by their unique green-tinged smoke \u2014 but so too were many people in Boston, and cities further afield. The green-smoking cigarettes soon came to be associated with good luck, whether as a result of successful advertising or through anecdotal tales of lucky events befalling Reinhart smokers. The new factory, too, has attracted a great deal of attention, drawing visits from influential industrial moguls and politicians alike.\n\nBut all is not well at Reinhart Tobacco. When company president Reinhart Laine is found dead in his luxury high-rise office, the Investigators are charged with discreetly looking into the matter. Who could have wanted the wealthy tycoon dead? Were his political affiliations in the bitter race for Arkham\u2019s next Mayor somehow a factor in his death? Or is the closely held \u201csecret recipe\u201d for Reinhart Cigarettes\u2019 distinctive green-smoking tobacco something that a rival company might be willing to kill to find out? Diving into this smoke-filled mystery might just leave the Investigators with questions about who really wields power in the sinuous town of Arkham \u2026 and what lengths others would go to to get it.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2019.0, "minplayers": null, "maxplayers": null, "playingtime": null, "minplaytime": null, "maxplaytime": null, "minage": null, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 4, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '16', 'name': 'rpgitem', 'friendlyname': 'RPG Item Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '16', 'name': 'rpgitem', 'friendlyname': 'RPG Item Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": null, "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 151224, "name": "Die Reisende Kaiserin", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KK2QLMP6e1I6KMZr4Hu7xQ__thumb/img/mJqWWmQA2oiINtgc4draKnmf1M4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1847265.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KK2QLMP6e1I6KMZr4Hu7xQ__original/img/RqDnQJvQLsjZpO6W1d-VeT-CkzQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1847265.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "[from the back of the book]\nThe court of the Empress: a place of authority, chivalry, intrigue. The grandees of the kingdom spend time at the court of Rohajas to bask in the glory of the empire of Raul, and also to exert tangible political power. It takes no wonder that the rulers of Aventuria face the courtyard of the Middle Empire and send ambassadors, diplomats and spies to feel the pulse of the Empire. But the court is not only a place of authority. It is home to the Empress and her family, surrounded by nobles and commoners, knights and courtiers, advisors and sycophants. But it is at it's brightest splendor, when the nobles of the kingdom shall be summoned to the court day to decide the fate of the empire, when tents and halls become places of representation.\n\nSince the imperial court started the eternal journey, it moves from Palatinate to Palatinate, from county to county to bring shine and power to places far from the old imperial city of Gareth. And the call that sends many ministers into sleepless nights lets simple people and the young knights tremble alike with anticipation: \"The Empress is coming!\"\n\nDie Reisende Kaiserin (The traveling Empress) presents the Imperial Court of the Middle Empire , with its officials and dignitaries , as well as its heroes and villains. In this sourcebook you will find a comprehensive overview of the actors on the court as well as a collection of palaces and  imperial fortresses, and a typical meeting of the nobles in the peaceful city of Ragath in Almada.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2013.0, "minplayers": null, "maxplayers": null, "playingtime": null, "minplaytime": null, "maxplaytime": null, "minage": null, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1, 'average': 7.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 16, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 1, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '16', 'name': 'rpgitem', 'friendlyname': 'RPG Item Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{}", "usersrated": 1.0, "average": 7.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 16.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 1.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '16', 'name': 'rpgitem', 'friendlyname': 'RPG Item Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": null, "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 320275, "name": "The Millennium War", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4uhILNum1pq_6TUZInqcfg__thumb/img/VXeV6cLI53mHNN4tK20i3inUmo0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5686997.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4uhILNum1pq_6TUZInqcfg__original/img/wOd0brkT-TZyHR1Sft1dxkLrhwc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5686997.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Upcoming Releases', 'Category: MOBA', 'Crowdfunding: Kickstarter', 'Traditional Games: Chess']", "categories": "['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Mythology']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "['Chuong Pham', 'Khanh Tran']", "artists": "['Andrii Akhtyrskyi', 'Dmitry Azanov', 'Fredo Bernardo', 'Chuong Pham', 'Calvin Seraphinus']", "publishers": "['Winged Titan LLC']", "description": "Once in a Millennium, when all the elements of the Universe are aligned, the Millennium gate emerges and releases powerful cosmic energies in the form of mythical beasts, sacred weapons and spells. This is an opportunity to harness the cosmic energy and win the prolonged war between 2 powerful forces: The Virtues and The Sinners.From around the world come the most powerful heroes from both spectrums. They travel to the dangerous shadow realm to claim the power and to keep it from falling into the enemy\u2019s hands. Whoever shall claim the millennium gate shall win the war, the Millennium War.\n\nIn the Millennium War, there are two game modes: competitive mode and cooperative mode. In competitive mode, players go head to head while building their strategy by selecting teams of legendary heroes, buying items, preparing passive spells to counterattack, and most importantly planning their actions by managing mana resources and movement across the Millennium Arena. \nThere are 3 ways to win in competitive mode: eliminate all your opponents' teams of heroes, destroy all your opponents' ancient structures or claim the Millennium Gate by hunting powerful mythical beasts. \nMillennium War's competitive mode is inspired by the popular MOBA games but adjusted to be one of a kind as a board game.  You don\u2019t win by speed and accuracy, or control of your keyboard, but by how you think and plan your strategy with a combination of choices. Similar to Chess but way more fun. Whether crushing your enemies with extreme power, trapping them with self destruct explosives and sacrificing one of your hero's for a few of theirs, brain controlling enemy hero's or even switching positions, there are endless ways to gain a strategic advantage. Build combos with 35 special Millennium Hero's and their endless combinations of weapons and spells.\nIn contrast to the swift pace of Competitive mode is the journey to the Millennium world in Cooperative mode, where players must work together to defeat Millennium Bosses. Each Boss presents a unique way of attack and has its own topography that\u2019ll require the entire team to solve the puzzle to defeat the powerful Boss.\nThe game offers countless excitement, it\u2019s fun and full of surprises, easy to play and tracks game play because of uniquely designed and patented smart dials, dealer shoes, hero cards and icons. Offering a supporting website featuring hero skills diagrams for easy learning, along with in depth character design inspired by world cultures and game mechanics. The game miniatures are lovingly made with highly detailed craftsmanship by talented artists from around the world. They also magnetically attach to the smart dial.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2022.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 120.0, "minplaytime": 45.0,

That resource type is harvested by the player currently growing it.\n\nRe-implemented by (with additional expansion):\n\n    Nile DeLuxor\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2009.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 30.0, "minplaytime": 30.0, "maxplaytime": 30.0, "minage": 8.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 394, 'average': 6.04055, 'bayesaverage': 5.58646, 'stddev': 1.50044, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 415, 'trading': 29, 'wanting': 9, 'wishing': 63, 'numcomments': 119, 'numweights': 28, 'averageweight': 1.5357, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8359}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 1802}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 8, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 7, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 394.0, "average": 6.04055, "bayesaverage": 5.58646, "stddev": 1.50044, "median": 0.0, "owned": 415.0, "trading": 29.0, "wanting": 9.0, "wishing": 63.0, "numcomments": 119.0, "numweights": 28.0, "averageweight": 1.5357, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8359}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 1802}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 40214, "name": "Bombay", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aUU-lvZU5RelIVmCBrbgxw__thumb/img/Zj00UYxnDFaHK8JTT_FDjUIT9zI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic419310.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aUU-lvZU5RelIVmCBrbgxw__original/img/YZ5aVwyo3COdvDLZAsWrAnM_lEc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic419310.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Animals: Elephants', 'Cities: Mumbai (India)', 'Country: India', 'Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena', 'Series: Ystari originals', 'Theme: Tropical']", "categories": "['Economic', 'Transportation']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Action Points', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Set Collection']", "designers": "['Cyril Demaegd']", "artists": "['St\u00e9phane Poinsot']", "publishers": "['Ystari Games']", "description": "Bombay sees the players take on the role of Merchants in the land of India.

Allied players can fly the game's namesakes, the F4U-1 Corsair and F6F Hellcat, as well as the British Firefly, the P47-N, and the P-61 Black Widow. Japanese players can counter with two models of late war Zero, the Ki-84 Frank, the N1K1 George, and the J2M Jack. New bomber types include the TBF Avenger, the B-29 Superfortress, and the Ki-49 Helen. There's even a new kind of bomber: the Attack Bomber, which can strafe and bomb. Two types are present in Corsair & Hellcats: the B-25C-1 field modification and the solid nose B-25J, which carried a dozen (!) fixed forward-firing .50 caliber machine guns.\n\nAll of these aircraft (plus many of the ones in Zero!) are used in seven new campaigns. Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz are carrier campaigns like those pioneered in Zero!. Solomon Islands, Philippines 1944, and Okinawa use the land campaign structure familiar to players of the previous games in the series. The other two campaigns are quite different, though. Guadalcanal models the drawn out struggle for control of the airspace above that island. Players allocate available aircraft to two missions each week in an attempt to force a withdrawal by their opponent. The campaign also includes the option to play the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz campaigns as part of the battle, feeding the results of the carrier encounters back into the main campaign. B-29s in China is a solitaire campaign representing the beginning of the strategic bombing offensive against Japan. The player controls three Superfortresses and must balance their activities between training, carrying supplies, repairing damage, and conducting bombing missions.\n\nIn addition, Corsairs & Hellcats includes new target types, skilled pilots, and ordnance. The game also has rules for Kamikazes, supply drops, submarines, and mine laying. There's even a new method of selecting skilled (and green) pilots and crews that reflects the changes in aircrew quality that both sides went through during the course of the war.

The player's tribe opposes the invaders advancing their tribe to win (scoring 15 points) before the Invaders summon all five of their warlords - their win.\n\nThe Vul\u2019Keth Invasion (solo mode) is designed to give a challenge to experienced players and capture the same feel as a multi-player game. The invaders take minimal and fast but impactful turns, giving the player tons of great decisions as they work to deny the invaders achieving goals.\n\nIf players thought it was enough for your tribe to master the lakes, forests and mountains they were sadly mistaken. Another mysterious tribe has appeared and these invaders - with their aggressive warlords - intend to drive the tribe players have choosen to be from this land. Players need to establish their tribe's dominance before it's too late!\n\nThe Vul\u2019Keth Invasion (solo mode) presents players with the challenge of racing to victory while holding back an invading tribe lead by warlords with unique powers that will disrupt and devastate your progress. Players will take their turns in the usual way using a unique board set up for two tribes. Don't expect the Vul'Keth invaders to be a usual opponent.\n\nEach turn the invaders will determine their actions by drawing a card from one of three action decks. These cards also supply them with a goal. Players must stop the Vul'Keth from achieving their goals or the invaders will be rewarded with resources. Not worried about a few resources? At the end of their turn the invaders summon a warlord for every six resources they have, and if all five of the warlords are summoned to your land then the battle is over and your tribe must flee in defeat at the hand of the Vul'Keth!\n\nThe Vul'Keth Invasion is compatable with the Bronze expansion (see: Rise of Tribes: Beasts & Bronze). When added in, the player may complete 3 Bronze Age Technologies for the win, or win by scoring 15 points, if traditional Stone Age resistance to the invasion is working the best.\n\nBonus: NEW 9th Tribe!\nThe Vul\u2019Keth foe inspired us to create the 9th unique playable tribe in multiplayer games.

You then choose how you want to use these dice: boost or blast...just try not to crash as if you roll too many crashes you will be out of luck!\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 0.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 60.0, "minplaytime": 20.0, "maxplaytime": 60.0, "minage": 8.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 41933, "name": "Combat Commander: Battle Pack #3 \u2013 Normandy", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9V9O34GX7FKAaI-ILNN4KA__thumb/img/mzg-RWsjbXQPAdyvZKzMLCemmk0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic655125.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9V9O34GX7FKAaI-ILNN4KA__original/img/YWRJuhEr3Fo7BtQF7IPQLpugoIQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic655125.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: France', 'Players: Two Player Only Games', 'Region: Normandy (France)', 'Series: Combat Commander']", "categories": "['Expansion for Base-game', 'Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Variable Player Powers']", "designers": "['John Foley']", "artists": "['Lee Brimmicombe-Wood', 'Chad Jensen', 'Rodger B.

CC: Normandy features seventeen new scenarios printed on cardstock -- one of which is a multi-scenario Campaign Game -- as well as eight new maps, added markers necessary for some of the scenarios,

The basic version can be mastered in a matter of minutes and is fun for the entire family. The play consists of forming words, lengthening existing words, combining words, and stealing words from your opponent(s). The advanced version is easy to learn but will stimulate and challenge even the most astute word gamers. In addition to the basic play, there are 20 action cards that create all kinds of excitement and dynamics between the players. In either version, each player competes for high score through word values, word length values, bonus letter values, bonus word values, other word bonuses, and the number / quality of words acquired by the end of the game.\n\nYou can also play the following;\n\u201cCross Words\u201d - plays similar to a crossword puzzle game, without the limits of a regular game.\n\u201cPlay On Words\u201d - plays similar to a 3-D crossword puzzle game, without standard limitations.\n\u201cFinding the Right Words\u201d - plays similar to a cubed word game, without the grid or cube.\n\u201cThe Last Word\u201d - plays similar to a word jumble or word search, with strategy & scoring options.\n\u201cSimple Words\u201d - plays similar to solitaire, but played with words and is more entertaining.\n\nYou can even play poker style games that involve many more strategies and scoring options, such as;\n\u201cWord For Word\u201d - plays similar to Texas Hold 'em.\n\u201cKeep Your Word\u201d - plays similar to 7-Card Stud.\n\u201cChoose Your Words\u201d - plays similar to 7-Card Draw.\n\u201cHold Your Words\u201d - plays similar to 7-Card No Draw.\n\u201cA Few Words\u201d - plays similar to 7-Card No Peek.\n\nIn addition, you get \"Your Words, Not Mine\" which creates several more variations of game play, allowing you to play many of the games backwards!

It is designed for a two-player game of approximately 20 models aside to take an hour or less for experienced players to play. At the same time it gives you all the tactics and control of alternate activation with detailed control of each model's actions.\n\nGame Mechanics \nAll dice rolls are with a d20, low rolls are better, special rules for rolling 1's and 20's (criticals).\nThe measurements are in cm for greater detail and variety amongst units.\nPlay alternates between players with each activating a single unit at a time (individual or squad) and once all units have gone the turn is over.\nThis is designed for an average 750 pt game to require approx. 20 figures a side.\nEach army plays different, each has a distinct appearance and background.\nThe majority of units are melee units with advantages stacked in favor of more aggressive play.\nAdditional rules cover malfunctions, spellcraft, special abilities, formations and many other advanced gaming features.\n\nDark Age is introduced in the book Genesis, which covers the forces of the Forsaken, led by St. Mark, and opens the setting of this world with their encounters against the non-human Dragyri. The Story continues in Exodus, with the Forces of St. Mary battling the Skarrd, and Evolution, where the Devotees of St. John encounter the Brood.\n\nThe revised Core Rules and several scenarios are presented by themselves in Essence.\n\nThe current version of the Dark Age miniatures rules is Dark Age: Apocalypse Core Rules with expanded current force lists in Dark Age: Apocalypse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Forcelists\n\n--from publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '122750', 'name': 'Dark Age: Essence'}, {'id': '122749', 'name': 'Dark Age: Evolution'}, {'id': '122748', 'name': 'Dark Age: Exodus'}, {'id': '122747', 'name': 'Dark Age: Genesis'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2002.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 90.0, "minplaytime": 90.0, "maxplaytime": 90.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 32, 'average': 7.575, 'bayesaverage': 5.52124, 'stddev': 1.9524, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 58, 'trading': 3, 'wanting': 8, 'wishing': 22, 'numcomments': 16, 'numweights': 8, 'averageweight': 2.75, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 15114}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2965}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 2, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 32.0, "average": 7.575, "bayesaverage": 5.52124, "stddev": 1.9524, "median": 0.0, "owned": 58.0, "trading": 3.0, "wanting": 8.0, "wishing": 22.0, "numcomments": 16.0, "numweights": 8.0, "averageweight": 2.75, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 15114}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2965}]", "game_family": "Dark Age", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 70323, "name": "Ruhrgebiet-Quiz", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_J_HT4OZzmLgTIuw7ehkMQ__thumb/img/euw0nw7IIwHDeP1H2fQSmjGgCFI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic719398.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_J_HT4OZzmLgTIuw7ehkMQ__original/img/fMe0rd1K8JkeEAV1SAB2npPcBcA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic719398.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Germany', 'Series: Grupello Quizes']", "categories": "['Card Game', 'Trivia']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "['Ulrich Harbecke']", "artists": "['Britta Waldmann']", "publishers": "['Grupello Verlag']", "description": "Simple trivia game with questions related to the German Ruhr area.

Those contracts will be resolved several turns hence, during which time the exchange rate may have changed. But the contract is resolved according to the original, agreed-upon rate, enabling players to make profit. Players can (and should) make contracts promising money they don't yet have, and may use the resultant loans to give them a temporary leg-up (provided that they think they can make up the difference before the loan comes due).\n\nOnce the game begins, there is zero randomness; every subtle, lovely tweak to the game state is the net result of the decisions each player makes. The game concludes when a player goes bankrupt, or when the last dividend has been paid. At that point, all monies are converted to the single strongest currency, and the player with the most money of that type wins.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2017.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 90.0, "minplaytime": 90.0, "maxplaytime": 90.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 327, 'average': 6.32832, 'bayesaverage': 5.62559, 'stddev': 2.06612, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 424, 'trading': 12, 'wanting': 88, 'wishing': 271, 'numcomments': 107, 'numweights': 18, 'averageweight': 3.8333, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6817}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1973}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 11, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 5}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 7}, '3': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 8, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 7, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 5}, '6': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 6}, '6+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}}}", "usersrated": 327.0, "average": 6.32832, "bayesaverage": 5.62559, "stddev": 2.06612, "median": 0.0, "owned": 424.0, "trading": 12.0, "wanting": 88.0, "wishing": 271.0, "numcomments": 107.0, "numweights": 18.0, "averageweight": 3.8333, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6817}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1973}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 92415, "name": "Monsters as Player Characters", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V9nvgvQW5E2DRY-b-IkDKA__thumb/img/jUIXNJ4cvq5-f2-fINr2SU4tFZg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic915463.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V9nvgvQW5E2DRY-b-IkDKA__original/img/w01sawuuU2YVQrZjaDa5YCfH_9I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic915463.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "From Introduction:\n\nThis supplement to the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game rule system allows players to play characters of races which are normally monsters.

Ragnar\u00f6k has come, and it\u2019s the end of the world! It\u2019s the Vikings\u2019 last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin\u2019s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar\u00f6k, the ultimate inescapable doom.\n\nMost player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \u201cGods\u2019 Gifts\u201d grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.\n\nPlayers must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents\u2019 strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent\u2019s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '174506', 'name': 'Blood Rage: 5th Player Expansion'}, {'id': '311901', 'name': 'Blood Rage: Fenrir'}, {'id': '174801', 'name': 'Blood Rage: Gods of \u00c1sgard'}, {'id': '193898', 'name': 'Blood Rage: Hili \u2013 The Even-Handed'}, {'id': '174388', 'name': 'Blood Rage: Kickstarter Exclusives'}, {'id': '350961', 'name': 'Blood Rage: Mountain Giant'}, {'id': '310026', 'name': 'Blood Rage: Mystic Troll'}, {'id': '175100', 'name': 'Blood Rage: Mystics of Midgard'}, {'id': '286883', 'name': 'Blood Rage: Promos Box'}, {'id': '365507', 'name': 'Blood Rage: Wolfman'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2015.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 90.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 90.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 41100, 'average': 7.96989, 'bayesaverage': 7.7967, 'stddev': 1.41333, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 49137, 'trading': 379, 'wanting': 1526, 'wishing': 12054, 'numcomments': 6130, 'numweights': 1334, 'averageweight': 2.8801, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 40}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 45}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 819, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 509}, '2': {'best_rating': 9, 'recommended_rating': 195, 'not_recommended_rating': 432}, '3': {'best_rating': 111, 'recommended_rating': 538, 'not_recommended_rating': 48}, '4': {'best_rating': 642, 'recommended_rating': 106, 'not_recommended_rating': 10}, '4+': {'best_rating': 111, 'recommended_rating': 188, 'not_recommended_rating': 172}}}", "usersrated": 41100.0, "average": 7.96989, "bayesaverage": 7.7967, "stddev": 1.41333, "median": 0.0, "owned": 49137.0, "trading": 379.0, "wanting": 1526.0, "wishing": 12054.0, "numcomments": 6130.0, "numweights": 1334.0, "averageweight": 2.8801, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 40}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 45}]", "game_family": "Blood Rage", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 10, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 272821, "name": "Koninkrijk", "alternative_names": "['Kingdoms']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/58Or03C3dwqdzm2gs44bZA__thumb/img/fi2RmOy-snqtIojz9E0fjAzQFOY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4627329.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/58Or03C3dwqdzm2gs44bZA__original/img/C-Vp4B_1pDP19YeM8MNXSKrfv1o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4627329.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena']", "categories": "['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game', 'Math', 'Medieval', 'Number']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Auction/Bidding', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building', 'Variable Player Powers']", "designers": "['Rogier J.C.

First player to 30 points wins in a normal game.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2012.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 15.0, "minplaytime": 15.0, "maxplaytime": 15.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 11733, "name": "Manchester Games", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AfX4tMM8534sQ5GTNDefvw__thumb/img/IlQ93rb9q7aTYQgyDsmvMuSEpQg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic48088.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AfX4tMM8534sQ5GTNDefvw__original/img/VPf59GXQfZFYD6UDlQECPbnMtag=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic48088.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Manchester (England, UK)', 'Country: England']", "categories": "['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game', 'Dice', 'Travel']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Area Movement', 'Open Drafting', 'Point to Point Movement']", "designers": "['(Uncredited)']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['Noetic Pastimes Limited']", "description": "8 different games, using a board which represents Greater Manchester (England), in as much as each of the spaces is named after a Greater Manchester place name and the positions are approximately related to geography.  Wigan borough place names have been excluded presumably because it upsets the symmetry of the board.\nAs well as the board, the games use counters, different colour skittle pieces.  Some of the games use a die and/or cards.\nThe rules to each game are brief (one A5 sheet or less) and simple.  They have varying degrees of tactical scope.  Some are race games but most are abstract strategies.  The main appeal is the use of local names, assuming that the player is 'local'.\n\nSome of the games use a random element in the piece set up (by drawing place name cards), some of the games use a random element in the movement allowance.  Only one game, Werneth, has no random element.\n\nThe limits in the number of players for each game seems to be more a function of the pieces issued rather than game balance.  There would seem to be scope for adding players if extra pieces were drafted in from another game.\n\nANCOATS (2-6 players) is a movement game.  Ability to move depends on the colour of the card drawn, the colour of the space the piece is on and the colour it is moving to.  The winner is the first player to land on the three places determined by a random selection of three cards at the start of the game.\n\nBURNAGE (2-6 players) a movement game collecting cards at each space visited, or challenging other players for the cards they have collected.  The winner being the first to collect a predetermined number of cards.\n\nIn OFFERTON (2 players) the start location of pieces is randomised by cards.  After that, distance of movement is determined by the points on each space.  The winner is the fist player to get their six counters in a contiguous line.\n\nPRESTOLEE (2-5 players) is a die movement game.  The winner is the first player to move to all 16 spaces of the player's colour, collecting a card at each location space.\n\nRUSHOLME (2-6 players) has randomized set up, but movement is then dictated by the points and colours of each space.  The winner is the first to collect a specified number of counters distributed around the board.\n\nSEEDLEY (2-4 players) is a card game which uses the board for reference.  A player can only pick up a place name card off the discard pile, if they are discarding an adjacent place name.\n\nWERNETH (2 players) Players take it in turns to place a counter on the board, until there are 12 in total.  They then place their coloured skittle on the board.  They then take it in turns to move the their skittle according to the points on the space, restrictions on combinations of the colour of the current space, the space it is moving to, the colour of the skittle, or the presence of a counter or opponent's skittle.  The loser is the first player who cannot make a legal move on their turn.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 0.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 0.0, "minplaytime": 0.0, "maxplaytime": 0.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 2, 'trading': 1, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 1, 'numcomments': 1, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2.0, "trading": 1.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 1.0, "numcomments": 1.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 88900, "name": "Don't Be Late", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "User Summary\n\nA very meta game: you are trying to get to a friend's house so that you can play the games for IF Comp 1996.\n\nWritten by Greg Ewing in ALAN.\nIF Comp 1996: 22nd place of 27 entries.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": null, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 1.0, "playingtime": null, "minplaytime": null, "maxplaytime": null, "minage": null, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '32', 'name': 'videogame', 'friendlyname': 'Video Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '6178', 'name': 'softwareinterpreter', 'friendlyname': 'Software Interpreter Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '32', 'name': 'videogame', 'friendlyname': 'Video Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '6178', 'name': 'softwareinterpreter', 'friendlyname': 'Software Interpreter Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": null, "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 139030, "name": "Fool the Farmer", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eytyCURbMSY6rJq9qMyA4w__thumb/img/92rgqqolqTzaCiant0vNqIjbzQk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1585429.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eytyCURbMSY6rJq9qMyA4w__original/img/w7CNWnVVtsim6F1lWK1_FPLc8TU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1585429.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[\"Children's Game\", 'Farming']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Player Elimination', 'Roll / Spin and Move']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "['Dudley D.

You represent a new airline that's trying to set up business in the U.S., but you have an entire country open to you, so where will you set up shop and how can you profit more than the other newcomers to ensure that you survive?\n\nIn Blue Skies, the game board presents players with thirty airports in thirty cities. Each airport has four gates, with you using 2-4 gates depending on the number of players. To set up, draw airport demand cards from the deck to seed airports with passengers. Whenever you place passengers on the board, draw from a bag that initially contains 100 red cubes and 25 green cubes; for each airport, continue drawing until you draw a red cube, then redistribute passengers at the open gates of that airport as evenly as possible.\n\n(Note that at most the first five airports drawn will have an open gate, and even those will start with only one open gate run by a local airline. All of the other passengers are just bunched up at the gate waiting for you to serve them!)\n\nEach player starts with three demand cards in hand, and they take turns choosing two gates with a purchase price of at most 6. Players adjust their income from 0, with their income being set to equal the number of passengers now waiting at their gates, then the game begins.\n\nOn a turn, each player in turn buys new gates at airports of their choice, spending at most 6 points and adding any unspent points to their score. You can buy out a local airline, set up gates in new cities, or purchase multiple gates in the same airport to try to dominate that area.\n\nEach player in turn then plays a demand card from their hand, drawing passengers form the bag to place one or more passengers at that location. Then demand cards equal to the number of players are drawn, and more passengers are ahead to those airports. The game board lists the number of cards for each airport, so you somewhat know the odds of where passengers might arrive.\n\nPlayers adjust their income to account for the opening of new gates, the redistribution of existing passengers, and the arrival of new passengers, then they add their income to their score. If a player now has at least 100 points or has placed their twentieth and final gate, the game ends immediately; otherwise, you add a local airline gate to each airport with passengers but no open gates, pass the first player marker, then start a new round.\n\nAt game's end, score the seven regions of the United States based on the player's dominance of those regions. Each airport has a scoring value, e.g., ORD is worth 4, and each gate you have in Chicago is worth 4 for determining dominance in both the Midwest region and the Central region. (ORD is one of four airports in two regions, with the others being JFK, LAX, and DFW.) If you have the most dominance in the Central region, you score 13 points, whereas second place is worth only 6 points. Whoever has the most points wins.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2020.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 45.0, "minplaytime": 45.0, "maxplaytime": 45.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 348, 'average': 6.24677, 'bayesaverage': 5.61814, 'stddev': 1.3414, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 302, 'trading': 20, 'wanting': 21, 'wishing': 133, 'numcomments': 100, 'numweights': 10, 'averageweight': 2.1, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 7043}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1983}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 11, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 4}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '3': {'best_rating': 6, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '4': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 348.0, "average": 6.24677, "bayesaverage": 5.61814, "stddev": 1.3414, "median": 0.0, "owned": 302.0, "trading": 20.0, "wanting": 21.0, "wishing": 133.0, "numcomments": 100.0, "numweights": 10.0, "averageweight": 2.1, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 7043}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1983}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 281259, "name": "Kardnar\u00f6k", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-oWzDmhk_9NXE6QoxXIo1w__thumb/img/5D2reRJyVGeYZ8qmemvBTN5fLdo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4769266.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-oWzDmhk_9NXE6QoxXIo1w__original/img/vgqKQ5iEWmD6SKusnpDaCExhU3E=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4769266.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Upcoming Releases', 'Digital Implementations: Tabletopia', 'Theme: Vikings']", "categories": "['Card Game', 'Medieval', 'Mythology']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Take That']", "designers": "['Alexander F.

As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\n\nWith the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.\n\nThe Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.\n\nPlayers have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.\n\nThe Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.\n\nThe miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.\n\nAction Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.\n\nOnce a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.\n\nThe round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.\n\nOnce the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '204573', 'name': 'Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016'}, {'id': '91072', 'name': 'Saboteur 2 (expansion-only editions)'}, {'id': '334146', 'name': 'Saboteur: 15 Jahre Jubil\u00e4ums-Sticker'}, {'id': '213290', 'name': 'Saboteur: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016 Promo'}, {'id': '281313', 'name': 'Saboteur: Cancellation'}, {'id': '353383', 'name': 'Saboteur: Change Order promo card'}, {'id': '290696', 'name': 'Saboteur: Das Stollenfest'}, {'id': '279956', 'name': 'Saboteur: Inventory'}, {'id': '227424', 'name': 'Saboteur: Map Swap'}, {'id': '353384', 'name': 'Saboteur: Master Craftsman promo card'}, {'id': '158605', 'name': 'Saboteur: Rock Gold'}, {'id': '336179', 'name': 'Saboteur: Sabotage Shift'}, {'id': '201027', 'name': 'Saboteur: Selfish Dwarf'}, {'id': '233013', 'name': 'Saboteur: The Wardrobe Cavern'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2004.0, "minplayers": 3.0, "maxplayers": 10.0, "playingtime": 30.0, "minplaytime": 30.0, "maxplaytime": 30.0, "minage": 8.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 29238, 'average': 6.55756, 'bayesaverage': 6.44057, 'stddev': 1.29348, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 48523, 'trading': 847, 'wanting': 226, 'wishing': 2076, 'numcomments': 5123, 'numweights': 1523, 'averageweight': 1.323, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 1236}, {'id': '5498', 'name': 'partygames', 'friendlyname': 'Party Game Rank', 'value': 123}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 416}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 350, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 247}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 248}, '3': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 46, 'not_recommended_rating': 226}, '4': {'best_rating': 15, 'recommended_rating': 116, 'not_recommended_rating': 158}, '5': {'best_rating': 68, 'recommended_rating': 200, 'not_recommended_rating': 21}, '6': {'best_rating': 128, 'recommended_rating': 147, 'not_recommended_rating': 13}, '7': {'best_rating': 195, 'recommended_rating': 84, 'not_recommended_rating': 6}, '8': {'best_rating': 161, 'recommended_rating': 94, 'not_recommended_rating': 11}, '9': {'best_rating': 71, 'recommended_rating': 137, 'not_recommended_rating': 36}, '10': {'best_rating': 55, 'recommended_rating': 135, 'not_recommended_rating': 52}, '10+': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 11, 'not_recommended_rating': 147}}}", "usersrated": 29238.0, "average": 6.55756, "bayesaverage": 6.44057, "stddev": 1.29348, "median": 0.0, "owned": 48523.0, "trading": 847.0, "wanting": 226.0, "wishing": 2076.0, "numcomments": 5123.0, "numweights": 1523.0, "averageweight": 1.323, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 1236}, {'id': '5498', 'name': 'partygames', 'friendlyname': 'Party Game Rank', 'value': 123}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 416}]", "game_family": "Saboteur", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "7", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 9220, "name": "Traumland", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MZWwrZKUi4hXKSm4Q3c_3Q__thumb/img/g3O_ShZga1UkGj8Q_CHVUSz1LRs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic39696.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MZWwrZKUi4hXKSm4Q3c_3Q__original/img/qRmNzBdOcxDYmF6RUfU1NawqyW0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic39696.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Card Game']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Trick-taking']", "designers": "['Hartmut Witt']", "artists": "['Andreas Steiner']", "publishers": "['Piatnik']", "description": "A trick-taking cardgame with themed cards from fairytales and novels.\n\nThere are four color suits in the game numbered 1-11 and two special cards; the \"Divine Card\" and \"The Dreamer\".

To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.\n\nThe players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.\n\nEach turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.\n\nAs new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '34410', 'name': 'Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2005.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 150.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 150.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 28130, 'average': 7.74094, 'bayesaverage': 7.55678, 'stddev': 1.47197, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 27845, 'trading': 577, 'wanting': 866, 'wishing': 5279, 'numcomments': 6285, 'numweights': 3223, 'averageweight': 3.8005, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 90}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 79}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 750, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 15, 'not_recommended_rating': 370}, '2': {'best_rating': 153, 'recommended_rating': 359, 'not_recommended_rating': 115}, '3': {'best_rating': 415, 'recommended_rating': 235, 'not_recommended_rating': 12}, '4': {'best_rating': 292, 'recommended_rating': 311, 'not_recommended_rating': 32}, '5': {'best_rating': 78, 'recommended_rating': 274, 'not_recommended_rating': 228}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 332}}}", "usersrated": 28130.0, "average": 7.74094, "bayesaverage": 7.55678, "stddev": 1.47197, "median": 0.0, "owned": 27845.0, "trading": 577.0, "wanting": 866.0, "wishing": 5279.0, "numcomments": 6285.0, "numweights": 3223.0, "averageweight": 3.8005, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 90}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 79}]", "game_family": "Caylus", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 320819, "name": "Disciples the Game", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6F2VbI3F-yJY-UCM7-8B4Q__thumb/img/zsyQGHDfmqLwle0qBW6aV3ZEH6w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5714174.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6F2VbI3F-yJY-UCM7-8B4Q__original/img/6UvZs-_bvBtV6OJm5LUpXN7Lfvc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5714174.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Crowdfunding: Kickstarter']", "categories": "['Humor', 'Mature / Adult', 'Religious']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Acting', 'Area Movement', 'Command Cards', 'Roll / Spin and Move']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Self-Published)']", "description": "Start a cult!

It combines the fun of an enjoyable game with the discovery of the world of butterflies and some of the most common species in the Mediterranean area.\n\nThe aim of the game, fun apart, is to build the richest habitat, and this is achieved by gaining the maximum number of points: completing butterflies, attracting them with plants, trying to make them breed, or catching them (with final penalisation). You also have to ensure that neither predators nor changes in the weather nor human intervention have a negative influence in the strategy of each player.\n\nThe game is designed for 2-5 players of all ages, and especially from 6 years old to an adult public. We have devised three levels of difficulty so that the learning process is gradual until dominating all the aspects of the game.\n\nThe game has a total of 66 cards, and 40 of them represent butterflies, 17 are actions by the players and 9 refer to the weather. The butterflies chosen represent more or less the variety of diurnal species in the area and the majority are grouped by colours, an approximation to the different families.\n\nPapilio is a game of simulation yet it is also competitive. This means that the dynamic of the game is agile and with continuous toing and froing, and at the end establishes a score in points that in some way is related to the concept of biodiversity and the biological cycles of these insects.\n\nThus there are more points for the butterflies that are free than those caught with butterfly nets. The diversity of the butterflies is also rewarded and the number of species of the same group. Finally, points are scored for the combination of plants and reproduction cards (caterpillars).

The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.\n\nWhich beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?\n\nPlayers have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!\n\nWhen a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.  This is the *really* tricky part.\n\nThe game ends after five swift rounds and all 10 of your cards played, maybe half an hour from start to finish.

Players will discard cards to satisfy the damage and if they can't discard enough, everyone loses.\n\nRich with tactical decisions and a deep heuristic tree, Regicide is a huge challenge for anyone who is brave enough to take it on.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\nFor a dice-based, typo-inspired, April 1st-announced game from the same designers, try Regidice!\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2020.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 30.0, "minplaytime": 10.0, "maxplaytime": 30.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 2381, 'average': 7.52391, 'bayesaverage': 6.60433, 'stddev': 1.26965, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 3365, 'trading': 19, 'wanting': 174, 'wishing': 1328, 'numcomments': 549, 'numweights': 65, 'averageweight': 1.9231, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 933}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 523}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 199}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 59, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 9, 'recommended_rating': 30, 'not_recommended_rating': 11}, '2': {'best_rating': 18, 'recommended_rating': 29, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '3': {'best_rating': 17, 'recommended_rating': 21, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '4': {'best_rating': 18, 'recommended_rating': 20, 'not_recommended_rating': 4}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 22}}}", "usersrated": 2381.0, "average": 7.52391, "bayesaverage": 6.60433, "stddev": 1.26965, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3365.0, "trading": 19.0, "wanting": 174.0, "wishing": 1328.0, "numcomments": 549.0, "numweights": 65.0, "averageweight": 1.9231, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 933}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 523}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 199}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 312484, "name": "Black Rose Wars: Summonings \u2013 Demons", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/moq5fBeGWdZqUqba49E-YQ__thumb/img/q4ehUk0GFHSiE20cevR_SqBH4Rc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5490449.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/moq5fBeGWdZqUqba49E-YQ__original/img/3K7YCYTkqPJRulXOMlFHDfa6MVw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5490449.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": true, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "['Marco Montanaro']", "artists": "['Fernando Armentano', 'Henning Ludvigsen', 'Giovanni Pirrotta', 'Paolo Scippo']", "publishers": "['Ludus Magnus Studio', 'Ares Games']", "description": "Summonings is a series of three all-miniature expansions for Black Rose Wars, which introduces three kinds of summoning creatures: Constructs, Undead, and Demons.\n\nSummonings: Demons is one of these miniature expansions, featuring a set of summoned creatures which your mage can bring into play.

Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck \u2014 unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.\n\nOn a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the \"fields\" in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete \u2014 and all trades on a turn must involve the active player \u2014 then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.\n\nWhen you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the \"beanometer\" for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.\n\nThe original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '35589', 'name': \"Auf der schw\u00e4b'schen Eisenbohn\"}, {'id': '103186', 'name': 'Bohn Camillo'}, {'id': '285164', 'name': 'Bohna Nostra'}, {'id': '467', 'name': 'Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set'}, {'id': '1494', 'name': 'Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set (Revised Edition)'}, {'id': '14118', 'name': 'Bohnanza: Amigo Bohnentaler'}, {'id': '189272', 'name': 'Bohnanza: Bean Market'}, {'id': '174239', 'name': 'Bohnanza: Bohnaparte & High Bohn'}, {'id': '43237', 'name': 'Bohnanza: Das Fanbuch'}, {'id': '216664', 'name': 'Bohnanza: Die Jokerbohnen'}, {'id': '453', 'name': 'Bohnanza: La Isla Bohnita'}, {'id': '168425', 'name': 'Bohnanza: Princes & Pirates'}, {'id': '35428', 'name': 'Bohnanza: Spiderbeans'}, {'id': '6264', 'name': 'Bohnaparte'}, {'id': '59416', 'name': 'Bohnedikt'}, {'id': '205687', 'name': 'Bohnedikt (2016 Edition)'}, {'id': '31419', 'name': 'Bohnr\u00f6schen'}, {'id': '178656', 'name': 'Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015'}, {'id': '8174', 'name': 'Dschingis Bohn'}, {'id': '111734', 'name': 'Fasolki: Rozszerzenie'}, {'id': '913', 'name': 'High Bohn'}, {'id': '12677', 'name': 'High Bohn Plus'}, {'id': '18793', 'name': 'High Bohn: Bohnenduell um 12 Uhr mittags'}, {'id': '4377', 'name': 'Ladybohn'}, {'id': '243505', 'name': 'Marco Bohno'}, {'id': '2571', 'name': 'Mutabohn'}, {'id': '13474', 'name': 'Telebohn'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1997.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 7.0, "playingtime": 45.0, "minplaytime": 45.0, "maxplaytime": 45.0, "minage": 13.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 42044, 'average': 7.04374, 'bayesaverage': 6.93333, 'stddev': 1.293, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 63781, 'trading': 1059, 'wanting': 382, 'wishing': 2882, 'numcomments': 9073, 'numweights': 2872, 'averageweight': 1.6737, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 492}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 129}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 623, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 385}, '2': {'best_rating': 22, 'recommended_rating': 96, 'not_recommended_rating': 355}, '3': {'best_rating': 56, 'recommended_rating': 334, 'not_recommended_rating': 120}, '4': {'best_rating': 276, 'recommended_rating': 257, 'not_recommended_rating': 10}, '5': {'best_rating': 369, 'recommended_rating': 145, 'not_recommended_rating': 6}, '6': {'best_rating': 156, 'recommended_rating': 253, 'not_recommended_rating': 58}, '7': {'best_rating': 56, 'recommended_rating': 240, 'not_recommended_rating': 134}, '7+': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 19, 'not_recommended_rating': 270}}}", "usersrated": 42044.0, "average": 7.04374, "bayesaverage": 6.93333, "stddev": 1.293, "median": 0.0, "owned": 63781.0, "trading": 1059.0, "wanting": 382.0, "wishing": 2882.0, "numcomments": 9073.0, "numweights": 2872.0, "averageweight": 1.6737, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 492}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 129}]", "game_family": "Bohnanza", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 27, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 13, "name": "Basari", "alternative_names": "['\u30d0\u30b6\u30ea']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TFsXHCy5o7paWDX2RqHkZA__thumb/img/xSw4hvYLFbJbsYUYz14pwitbjFI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic147370.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TFsXHCy5o7paWDX2RqHkZA__original/img/j5BnK3mj-9oxq_qxRgSTJzVVQ08=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic147370.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Components: Gems/Crystals', 'Misc: Mensa Select', 'Occupation: Merchant']", "categories": "['Negotiation']", "implementations": "['Basari: Das Kartenspiel', 'Edel, Stein & Reich']", "mechanics": "['Roll / Spin and Move', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']", "designers": "['Reinhard Staupe']", "artists": "['John Kovalic', 'L\u00fcders & Baran', 'Stefan Theurer']", "publishers": "['F.X.

The actions are:\n- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, \n- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or \n- to roll and move again and also collect points.\n\nThe action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.\n\nA new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n\n     Edel, Stein & Reich\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1998.0, "minplayers": 3.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 25.0, "minplaytime": 25.0, "maxplaytime": 25.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1669, 'average': 6.75068, 'bayesaverage': 6.09984, 'stddev': 1.21819, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1935, 'trading': 85, 'wanting': 48, 'wishing': 209, 'numcomments': 667, 'numweights': 182, 'averageweight': 1.8571, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2220}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1088}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 646}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 40, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 27}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 26}, '3': {'best_rating': 7, 'recommended_rating': 20, 'not_recommended_rating': 7}, '4': {'best_rating': 33, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 18}}}", "usersrated": 1669.0, "average": 6.75068, "bayesaverage": 6.09984, "stddev": 1.21819, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1935.0, "trading": 85.0, "wanting": 48.0, "wishing": 209.0, "numcomments": 667.0, "numweights": 182.0, "averageweight": 1.8571, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2220}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': 1088}, {'id': '5499', 'name': 'familygames', 'friendlyname': 'Family Game Rank', 'value': 646}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 41, "name": "David & Goliath", "alternative_names": "['David and Goliath', '\u5927\u536b\u4e0e\u6b4c\u5229\u4e9a (\u5927\u885b\u8207\u6b4c\u5229\u4e9e)']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XTkkx0j13h77fnCG7mYI3A__thumb/img/XCpA1Xdr0NDRTZ9dt1ZnXFQzR3o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic359902.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XTkkx0j13h77fnCG7mYI3A__original/img/a08G83lXvnLaMCgSA9cExpDTvII=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic359902.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Animals: Mice', 'Religious: The Bible']", "categories": "['Card Game']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Trick-taking']", "designers": "['Reinhard Staupe']", "artists": "['Alexander Bradley', 'Oliver Freudenreich']", "publishers": "['Berliner Spielkarten', 'Pegasus Spiele', 'Playroom Entertainment', 'Wargames Club Publishing']", "description": "This game adds a very interesting twist to the standard trick-taking genre.

America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.\n\nUp to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special \"Star Wars\" laser relay systems that fire from space.\n\nThe game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n\n    Fortress America (2012)\n\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '32619', 'name': '5th Column (fan expansion for Fortress America)'}, {'id': '13119', 'name': 'Fortress America: Expansion Pack #1'}, {'id': '27727', 'name': 'Fortress Illinois'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1986.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 180.0, "minplaytime": 180.0, "maxplaytime": 180.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 2457, 'average': 6.70282, 'bayesaverage': 6.14047, 'stddev': 1.52858, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 3975, 'trading': 171, 'wanting': 142, 'wishing': 411, 'numcomments': 878, 'numweights': 246, 'averageweight': 2.6382, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2074}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 451}, {'id': '5496', 'name': 'thematic', 'friendlyname': 'Thematic Rank', 'value': 454}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 44, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 24}, '2': {'best_rating': 23, 'recommended_rating': 16, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '3': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 27, 'not_recommended_rating': 9}, '4': {'best_rating': 29, 'recommended_rating': 8, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 25}}}", "usersrated": 2457.0, "average": 6.70282, "bayesaverage": 6.14047, "stddev": 1.52858, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3975.0, "trading": 171.0, "wanting": 142.0, "wishing": 411.0, "numcomments": 878.0, "numweights": 246.0, "averageweight": 2.6382, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 2074}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 451}, {'id': '5496', 'name': 'thematic', 'friendlyname': 'Thematic Rank', 'value': 454}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true, "bga": true}, {"id": 115, "name": "Quo Vadis?", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AyOfO7atmdQP23YZikTO3A__thumb/img/XwzZuBmdOTIjQblFyb08-ZAOISY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3008003.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AyOfO7atmdQP23YZikTO3A__original/img/pjnoS2mrcfQsQ4AEN3nHhCtlp2I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3008003.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Ancient: Rome', 'Category: Combinatorial']", "categories": "['Ancient', 'Negotiation', 'Political']", "implementations": "['Zoo Vadis']", "mechanics": "['Point to Point Movement', 'Trading', 'Voting']", "designers": "['Reiner Knizia']", "artists": "['Pete Fenlon', 'Jason Hawkins', 'Jessica Ney', 'Franz Vohwinkel', 'Stephen Graham Walsh']", "publishers": "['Hans im Gl\u00fcck', 'AMIGO', 'Mayfair Games']", "description": "In an interesting departure from his normally computational-heavy game structure, Reiner Knizia put together this negotiation game.

But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.\n\nThe earliest mention of Go (\u00e5\u0153\u008d\u00e6\u00a3\u2039 (w\u00e9i q\u00ed)- \"surrounding game\") appears in the \"Analects\" of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17\u00d717 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son.

A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards).

INTRODUCTION\nWith the hero's success in destroying the Black Knight's plan in Dawn, it took longer for him to organise his minions. But the time has come at last, the Great War has begun! Backed up by a very strong Dark Magic, he commands a huge army of Greenskins including the fierce  Goblorcs, unnatural Beasts, and now the Ice Monsters and even the Undeads have joined his army. The worst part is the Light Sword's new power -- the Black Knight now can heal his minions around him, including himself, in seconds!\n\nApproaching from the west , in a very short time three castles have fallen to his hands, and his armies are swiftly heading to the capital of D. Once again everything seems hopeless and the King of D has called the 18 legendary heroes to gather in the Dungeon of D, deep in the Forest of D to the south, where legend says that centuries ago the Great Wizard of D hid the Amulet of D'eugor. It is believed that only the legendary Amulet of D'eugor can nullify the Light Sword\u2019s power. Unfortunately, the Black Knight knew about this too, so he placed a very strong magical barrier on the entrance to keep anyone from entering.\n\nLuckily, the King has also summoned Daryn and Derek. They can combine their magical abilities to open the barrier for a very short time, allowing just one person to enter the dungeon. But even with their combined power, they can only do this once every three hours. So, one by one the 18 heroes enter the dungeon, hoping to find the Amulet of D'eugor and survive to exit the dungeon. So far no one has returned\u2026 and you are hero number 18, the last person to enter the dungeon.

In the historical battle, the US Second Marine Division had 3 days to clear the island of Japanese soldiers.  The bloody battle inflicted nearly 3,000 casualties on the Marines; only 17 of 4,700 Japanese soldiers survived.  The solitaire game places the player in command of the US forces to determine how he performs compared to the historical outcome.\n\nA map overlaid with a hexagonal grid forms the game's playing field.  In the middle lies the isle of Tarawa, surrounded by water.  The terrain and Japanese defenses are also printed out, as well as the US-designated landing beaches.  Each turn, the player receives an amount of forces to deploy onto the beaches.  He handles attacks between the two armies, rolling dice and checking tables to resolve their effects.  When the Marines has defeated the Japanese in a hex, a cleared marker is placed on it (and removed if the US forces retreat from the hex due to a counterattack).  If the Japanese attack is particularly effective, the Marines suffers casualties, which is reflected by moving a marker on the Casualty Track.  The player also has to concern him with Booby-Traps, Snipers, Air Raids, Morale, and Supply.\n\nThe game ends at the end of the third turn.  The player wins if all hexes of the island are cleared and the Casualty Track reflects less than 5,000 casualties.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1992.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 1.0, "playingtime": 360.0, "minplaytime": 360.0, "maxplaytime": 360.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 35, 'average': 5.48571, 'bayesaverage': 5.49746, 'stddev': 1.93644, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 161, 'trading': 8, 'wanting': 7, 'wishing': 18, 'numcomments': 21, 'numweights': 9, 'averageweight': 2.5556, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 19651}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 3623}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '1+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 35.0, "average": 5.48571, "bayesaverage": 5.49746, "stddev": 1.93644, "median": 0.0, "owned": 161.0, "trading": 8.0, "wanting": 7.0, "wishing": 18.0, "numcomments": 21.0, "numweights": 9.0, "averageweight": 2.5556, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 19651}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 3623}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 6912, "name": "The High Crusade", "alternative_names": "['The High Crusade']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z_nQVrL68W--Y59mmecPaQ__thumb/img/QrEbnBIZ0RXBQoN8z7a18cbndN0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic40448.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z_nQVrL68W--Y59mmecPaQ__original/img/FP4Ovog9uXG8GdQ4cJTFgy0fRZ8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic40448.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Components: Map (Interplanetary or Interstellar scale)', 'Magazine: Ares', 'Players: Two Player Only Games']", "categories": "['Medieval', 'Novel-based', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['David \"Zeb\" Cook', 'Edward G.

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.\n\nThe tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the \"Ace\" of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think \"White dragon in a snowstorm\"), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.\n\nFour players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling \"Chow\"), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling \"Pung\"), pairs, and other patterns. \"Pung\" takes precedence over \"Chow\", and \"Mah Jongg\" takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw \"Chow\" out-of-turn.) What happens if a single discard would give two (or more!) players \"Mah Jongg\"? Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.\n\nOriginating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.  Although the rules for game play are fairly constant, there are an immense variety of scoring schemes.  A few general categories of rule-sets include:  Chinese Classical, Hong Kong Old Style, Japanese, Taiwanese, Western, and American.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1850.0, "minplayers": 3.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 120.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 120.0, "minage": 8.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 7031, 'average': 7.03407, 'bayesaverage': 6.65829, 'stddev': 1.66763, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 10141, 'trading': 107, 'wanting': 57, 'wishing': 507, 'numcomments': 1584, 'numweights': 476, 'averageweight': 2.5693, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 846}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': 64}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 104, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 74}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 11, 'not_recommended_rating': 69}, '3': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 37, 'not_recommended_rating': 45}, '4': {'best_rating': 96, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '4+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 70}}}", "usersrated": 7031.0, "average": 7.03407, "bayesaverage": 6.65829, "stddev": 1.66763, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10141.0, "trading": 107.0, "wanting": 57.0, "wishing": 507.0, "numcomments": 1584.0, "numweights": 476.0, "averageweight": 2.5693, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 846}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': 64}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 248430, "name": "Stealth Force 2", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "From back of game.

The dragon was magnificent, even to a deity of travel who has seen unimaginable sights. Despite its awe-inspiring presence, it waited for her words. She talked of the codex and of how Hastur, the King in Yellow, fought to steal it, ransacking the infinite planes to find it. The guardian rumbled understanding, so Liikkua drew a simple map of six planes, separate from each other but connected by a sense of order. She folded it into a cube and shaped a key phrase for each face. She set the dragon and codex into the cube\u2014despite it being just 2 inches on each side\u2014and then picked up a simple atlas of 144 maps. She leafed through it and devised a mystery for each one, before allocating it to random future travelers. Then she pushed the cube through the tome\u2019s cover, unaware of where it would end up, waiting to be found. But the concentration it took to complete the encasing ritual meant she missed the tiny yellow moth with tattered wings fluttering at her side.

Despite the fact they are the original humans, the Solomani are confusing to outsiders and often portrayed as despicable in Imperial propaganda. The Droyne and the Hivers are alien in both physical form and way of thinking. Both make many outsiders uneasy \u2013 and with good reason.\n\nThis book contains rules for creating Travellers from each of these alien races, High Guard additions and new ships, and Central Supply Catalogue entries for their new equipment.\n\nThe Solomani\n\nThe Solomani are the original humans, left behind on Earth when the Ancients transplanted Humaniti throughout Charted Space. The Solomani are convinced of their own superiority and the \u2018Call to Greatness\u2019 felt by all their people. They have much to be proud of; inventing the jump drive and conquering the vast Vilani Imperium to name but two of their achievements. Yet there is a darker side to Solomani society, with the ever-present agents of Solomani Security reporting on the words and deeds of every citizen. Aliens of Charted Space Volume 2 reveals the motivation of the Solomani people and why they genuinely believe they are better than everyone else.\n\nThe Droyne\n\nScattered all across Charted Space are communities of Droyne; some voyaging among the stars and others sharpening rocks to use as tools. The Droyne would be among the most enigmatic of all the people in Charted Space even if they were not known to be a remnant of the Ancients. Droyne do not explain their often bizarre actions, but there must be a logic to them. This book reveals the secrets of this strange alien race.\n\nThe Hivers\n\nThe most physically alien of all people in Charted Space, the Hivers are renowned for their ability to manipulate others into doing their bidding. They are alleged to have manipulated whole starfaring societies, altering the course of their history. Apparently emotionless yet ever-curious, the Hivers control a huge federation in which many races serve a role created for them by the Hivers. Aliens of Charted Space Volume 2 shows the motivations and long-term plans of the Hive Federation.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2020.0, "minplayers": null, "maxplayers": null, "playingtime": null, "minplaytime": null, "maxplaytime": null, "minage": null, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1, 'average': 7.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 15, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 2, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '16', 'name': 'rpgitem', 'friendlyname': 'RPG Item Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{}", "usersrated": 1.0, "average": 7.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 2.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '16', 'name': 'rpgitem', 'friendlyname': 'RPG Item Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": null, "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 335090, "name": "D\u00f8dekongens l\u00f8jtnant", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MdmMu4wQvTQhlYXLJy3qaQ__thumb/img/1t6p1gLRT7Oflw96KuTzzLUDnv8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6080445.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MdmMu4wQvTQhlYXLJy3qaQ__original/img/dSDOv6Iyll-DJcEtIwOZzekm9tM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6080445.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "Author's blurb:\n\nEt hulesystem, der peger p\u00e5 den trussel, som truer.

Players then take turn drafting a die, moving either the red or blue farmer meeple that number of sections, and placing the two animals from that section onto their farm that matches the color of the farmer. The last die remaining after all players have taken one is used to rotate the wheel.\n\nPlayers also start with some milk tokens that can modify the values of dice by \u00b11.\n\nThe game ends after ten rounds (with your farms hopefully now being full), and players score points.

The game is played like UNO; players take turns playing a card which has the same color or number as the top card of discard pile. Each time a card is played, its effect is activated. Players could be forced to change their roles or even eliminated from the game.\n\nThe game ends when a player gets rid of all cards in their hand, in which case that player wins the game. All of that player's allies win together, but only if there is an opposing side of the winner. The game also ends when the deck runs out, in which case the side with the lower total value in their hands wins the game if there are two sides. Otherwise the player with the lowest total value in their hand wins the game.\n\nSometimes you are required to co-operate to win as a team, but you win anyway if you go out. It is an effective strategy to focus on winning alone.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\u00e5\u0178\u00ba\u00e6\u0153\u00ac\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e3\u0081\u00abUNO\u00ef\u00bc\u008f\u00e3\u201a\u00a6\u00e3\u0192\u017d\u00e3\u0081\u00a7\u00e3\u0081\u2122\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\u00e9\u2122\u00a3\u00e5\u2013\u00b6\u00e6\u02c6\u00a6\u00e8\u00a6\u0081\u00e7\u00b4\u00a0\u00e3\u0081\u00a8\u00e3\u201a\u00ab\u00e3\u0192\u00bc\u00e3\u0192\u2030\u00e3\u0081\u00ab\u00e7\u2030\u00b9\u00e6\u00ae\u0160\u00e5\u0160\u00b9\u00e6\u017e\u0153\u00e3\u0081\u0152\u00e3\u0081\u201a\u00e3\u201a\u0160\u00e3\u0081\u00be\u00e3\u0081\u2122\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\u00e9\u2122\u00a3\u00e5\u2013\u00b6\u00e3\u201a\u2019\u00e7\u00a4\u00ba\u00e3\u0081\u2122\u00e6\u00ad\u00a3\u00e4\u00bd\u201c\u00e3\u201a\u00ab\u00e3\u0192\u00bc\u00e3\u0192\u2030\u00e3\u0081\u00af\u00e3\u20ac\u017d\u00e4\u00ba\u00ba\u00e9\u2013\u201c\u00e3\u20ac\u008f\u00e3\u20ac\u0081\u00e3\u20ac\u017d\u00e7\u2039\u0090\u00e3\u20ac\u008f\u00e3\u20ac\u0081\u00e3\u20ac\u017d\u00e4\u00b9\u009d\u00e5\u00b0\u00be\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e7\u2039\u0090\u00e3\u20ac\u008f\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00ef\u00bc\u201c\u00e7\u00a8\u00ae\u00e9\u00a1\u017e\u00e3\u0081\u00a7\u00e3\u20ac\u0081\u00e4\u00ba\u00ba\u00e9\u2013\u201c\u00e9\u2122\u00a3\u00e5\u2013\u00b6\u00e3\u0081\u00a8\u00e4\u00b9\u009d\u00e5\u00b0\u00be\u00e9\u2122\u00a3\u00e5\u2013\u00b6\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00ef\u00bc\u2019\u00e3\u0081\u00a4\u00e3\u0081\u00ab\u00e5\u02c6\u2020\u00e3\u0081\u2039\u00e3\u201a\u0152\u00e3\u0081\u00a6\u00e3\u0081\u201e\u00e3\u0081\u00be\u00e3\u0081\u2122\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\n\u00e3\u201a\u00a6\u00e3\u0192\u017d\u00e5\u0090\u0152\u00e6\u00a7\u02dc\u00e3\u20ac\u0081\u00e6\u2030\u2039\u00e6\u0153\u00ad\u00e3\u201a\u2019\u00e5\u2021\u00ba\u00e3\u0081\u2014\u00e5\u02c6\u2021\u00e3\u201a\u0152\u00e3\u0081\u00b0\u00e8\u2021\u00aa\u00e5\u02c6\u2020\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e9\u2122\u00a3\u00e5\u2013\u00b6\u00e3\u0081\u201d\u00e3\u0081\u00a8\u00e5\u2039\u009d\u00e3\u0081\u00a1\u00e3\u0081\u00be\u00e3\u0081\u2122\u00e3\u0081\u2014\u00e3\u20ac\u0081\u00e3\u0081\u009d\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e5\u2030\u008d\u00e3\u0081\u00ab\u00e5\u00b1\u00b1\u00e6\u0153\u00ad\u00e3\u0081\u0152\u00e5\u02c6\u2021\u00e3\u201a\u0152\u00e3\u0081\u0178\u00e5\u00a0\u00b4\u00e5\u0090\u02c6\u00e3\u0081\u00af\u00e3\u20ac\u0081\u00e9\u2122\u00a3\u00e5\u2013\u00b6\u00e3\u0081\u201d\u00e3\u0081\u00a8\u00e3\u0081\u00ab\u00e3\u201a\u00ab\u00e3\u0192\u00bc\u00e3\u0192\u2030\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e5\u0090\u02c6\u00e8\u00a8\u02c6\u00e5\u20ac\u00a4\u00e3\u201a\u2019\u00e6\u00af\u201d\u00e3\u0081\u00b9\u00e5\u0090\u02c6\u00e3\u0081\u2020\u00e5\u02c6\u00a4\u00e5\u00ae\u0161\u00e6\u02c6\u00a6\u00e3\u0081\u00ab\u00e3\u0081\u00aa\u00e3\u201a\u0160\u00e3\u0081\u00be\u00e3\u0081\u2122\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\n\u00e9\u2122\u00a3\u00e5\u2013\u00b6\u00e6\u02c6\u00a6\u00e3\u0081\u00aa\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e3\u0081\u00a7\u00e5\u008d\u201d\u00e5\u0160\u203a\u00e8\u00a6\u0081\u00e7\u00b4\u00a0\u00e3\u0081\u0152\u00e3\u0081\u201a\u00e3\u201a\u0160\u00e3\u0081\u00be\u00e3\u0081\u2122\u00e3\u0081\u0152\u00e3\u20ac\u0081\u00e9\u2122\u00a3\u00e5\u2013\u00b6\u00e3\u0081\u00af\u00e3\u201a\u00b2\u00e3\u0192\u00bc\u00e3\u0192\u00a0\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e3\u20ac\u0081\u00e6\u00b5\u0081\u00e5\u2039\u2022\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e3\u0081\u00ab\u00e5\u00a4\u2030\u00e5\u0152\u2013\u00e3\u0081\u2014\u00e3\u20ac\u0081\u00e3\u0081\u201e\u00e3\u0081\u00a3\u00e3\u0081\u009d\u00e4\u00b8\u20ac\u00e4\u00ba\u00ba\u00e5\u2039\u009d\u00e3\u0081\u00a1\u00e3\u201a\u2019\u00e7\u2039\u2122\u00e3\u0081\u201e\u00e3\u0081\u00ab\u00e8\u00a1\u0152\u00e3\u0081\u008f\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e3\u201a\u201a\u00e6\u0153\u2030\u00e5\u0160\u00b9\u00e3\u0081\u00aa\u00e6\u02c6\u00a6\u00e7\u2022\u00a5\u00e3\u0081\u00a7\u00e3\u0081\u2122\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\n\n",

The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.\n\nThis is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.\n\nSo if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (\"Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool\"). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (\"This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!\"). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.\n\nAnd if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).\n\nThere are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.\n\nThe winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1997.0, "minplayers": 3.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 30.0, "minplaytime": 30.0, "maxplaytime": 30.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 170, 'average': 6.16147, 'bayesaverage': 5.55681, 'stddev': 1.29752, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 260, 'trading': 18, 'wanting': 17, 'wishing': 26, 'numcomments': 57, 'numweights': 11, 'averageweight': 2.0909, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10250}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '3': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 170.0, "average": 6.16147, "bayesaverage": 5.55681, "stddev": 1.29752, "median": 0.0, "owned": 260.0, "trading": 18.0, "wanting": 17.0, "wishing": 26.0, "numcomments": 57.0, "numweights": 11.0, "averageweight": 2.0909, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10250}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 258, "name": "It's Mine!", "alternative_names": "['Bzzz\u2026 PLASK!', 'La Folie des Glandeurs', 'Grab', 'Grab!', 'Her Damit', 'The Simpsons: Slam Dunk', 'Zampabollos']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A3fpOaxuSYPPwRypP1-irw__thumb/img/Zfp6VB2c3ybZgWlVujWDMYKUim4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic324995.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A3fpOaxuSYPPwRypP1-irw__original/img/qma9TW4Ir9GU2UriQ_XcBPzJy2U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic324995.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['TV Shows: The Simpsons']", "categories": "['Card Game', 'Real-time']", "implementations": "['SWAT!', 'Take It!']", "mechanics": "['Memory', 'Set Collection']", "designers": "['Reiner Knizia']", "artists": "['Charlie Bink', 'Matt Groening', 'Maureen Wingrove']", "publishers": "['Cocktail Games', 'Egmont Polska', 'Popular de Juguetes', 'Top Cards', 'Winning Moves Games (USA)', 'Winning Moves International Ltd']", "description": "It's this simple - watch the cards the dealer lays down.

Initially players bet on the horses as they are dealt from the deck, then the horses race on the die roll, the course being 40 spaces. The cards & die have 4 symbols, jockey's hat, boot, horse shoe and horse's head; the head is on the die 3 times, giving it a 50% chance of being rolled. The cards have different values against each symbol, showing how far they move when that symbol is rolled. But the number against the horse's head is always 1 to 7 for the same horse. So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags? Players take turns to roll the die and choose which horse moves, so with a good roll you move one you've bet on, with a bad roll you move someone else's horse.

Controlling one of twelve historically accurate civilizations of the era \u2013 Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Elamites, Ebla, Egyptians, Gutians, Hittites, Kassites, Mitanni, Nomads or Sumerians \u2013 players attempt to dominate the game board by creating farms, towns, embassies, ziggurats, and even armies. Each civilization has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the game has no luck elements.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2012.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 20.0, "minplaytime": 20.0, "maxplaytime": 20.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 7, 'average': 7.85714, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.788954, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 4, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 3, 'wishing': 25, 'numcomments': 6, 'numweights': 2, 'averageweight': 2.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 7.0, "average": 7.85714, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.788954, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 3.0, "wishing": 25.0, "numcomments": 6.0, "numweights": 2.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": true}, {"id": 328479, "name": "Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden Dungeon Master's Screen", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z56bSQ6WrKRQjhY_UJbmNw__thumb/img/VT85hR3NBlkBfxL0aarsKDLB2cM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5898433.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z56bSQ6WrKRQjhY_UJbmNw__original/img/bOKaG6xVrTrt4j6fU6-XSe0G6Ig=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5898433.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[]", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "[]", "description": "From the product's slip sheet:\n\nIn Icewind Dale, adventure is a dish best served cold.

On a turn, you roll three dice, with each die face showing a balloon color and a shape, then record the results by circling numbers from the bottom of the column, going up. The highest number you circle in a column equals the points that you score.\n\nNot happy with your results? Then roll again with any number of dice \u2014 but you have to roll an additional die as well, which means you'll circle more results on your scoresheet. You can reroll a second time as well to add a fifth die to your results. This (possibly) gives you better control over the results, while helping you ascend the columns more quickly to higher potential scores.\n\nHowever, at the top of each column is a different colored number that's much lower than the numbers immediately below it.

It is an essential dungeon exploration game with hundreds of hours of playability and many unique features ~ including the fact that it may be played as a single player (SP) game or, with its included server, as an on-line game where a group of up to sixteen players from around the world or in a local neighbourhood, may play the Multi-Player (MP) version.\nAs the game progresses beyond Volume I there is more interaction with the monsters and the occasional Non-Player Character (NPC) and a broader picture of the environment around the Dungeon and City of Dejenol emerges.\n\nThe game is played with characters whose attributes have been determined by the player and with the aim of progressively making your character or characters stronger, more capable and able to survive in the rich environment that will progressively unfold. \nIn both single player(SP) and multiplayer(MP) you can explore the dungeon in a group of up to four characters.  In SP these characters are all created by you and you have complete control of them.  In MP, you can only play one character at a time, and must join with other players in order to make a party. Of course you can also choose to play with only one character, but a party has a greater chance of surviving the many perils that lie in the dungeon and beyond.\n\nThere are 9 different humanoid species which you may select for your character.  Think Human, Elf, Dwarf, Giant ... you get the idea!  Your choice determines how long you live, your basic characteristics (some are faster/stronger/smarter than others), your starting resistances to any special forms of attack (such as poison or acid), what alignment you can be (Good, Neutral or Evil), and which \"Guilds\" you can join.  A Guild is an organization dedicated to a profession ... but all characters start out as an 'Artisan' - a \"Jack of all trades and master of none\".\n\nThere are 12 guilds in Demise, and your standing in these guilds represents how powerful your character is. Some Guilds only accept certain species, and some will not admit certain alignments, so think carefully about making these choices.\n\nGuilds represent a way of life, and gaining levels as a member of  each Guild you choose increases the skills your character has related to that particular Guild.  The Warriors' Guild teaches characters how to fight, the Thieves Guild teaches characters to open chests without setting off traps, and the Sorceror's Guild teaches characters how to cast powerful spells at enemies.  In Ascension, a character can be anywhere from level 1 to level 1499 in a Guild to which they belong, with a level 1 character being a wimpy NOOB, and a level 1499 character being extremely knowledgeable and powerful in the ways of the Guild ( and perhaps a PITA on the forums ;-) ).\n\nA character may be a member of more than one Guild at a time, but they can only learn (gain experience) from one guild at a time, and may switch their \"active\" Guild at any time.  However, since Guilds represent a way of life, certain Guilds are forbidden to use some types of weapons, armour or other items.  The Sorceror's Guild will not allow their member to swing a huge sword at his enemies as he or she may as a member of the Warrior's Guild, but similarly, when actively enrolled in the Warrior's Guild, he or she may not be able to use that powerful magic item that was 'won' in the last battle.\n\nThe original dungeon in Demise was limited to a little over 30 dungeon levels.  In each of these levels there are multiple areas or rooms, which are in turn are mapped to square cells (think of each cell as a 10' x 10' area or 3 square metres ). Note that the original dungeon was limited to 45 by 45 cells on each level.  Ascension 'includes' the original dungeon and game of course, but has more than doubled the area that may be explored with the addition of access to the regions beyond and further below.\n\nAn area or room may (and usually does) contain monsters that are increasingly more treacherous the deeper you travel in the original dungeon or the further 'abroad' you travel in the new regions.  Monsters can come in up to four groups.  Each monster in a group is of the same type, but there may be four groups of different types of monster.  There could be four groups of slaves in a room, OR there could be a group of 2 slavers, a group of 12 slaves, a giant centipede, and two black bears in a room.  If they delight in killing or think the characters have something useful or valuable on them, monsters will likely be hostile, but if the character or party look powerful, they might be warily peaced and possibly even run away.\n\nEvery time a character damages or kills a monsters he or she gains experience.  If a character gains enough experience, and are able to afford the fee, a level may be gained in their current guild, making them more powerful, and more likely to survive the dungeon.  When a character defeats a monster they may also find some gold, possibly an item and perhaps even a treasure chest.  As the characters grow more powerful, they can defeat stronger monsters, who will have more gold and better items.  The characters may also come across books of magic, which they can give to the magic using Guilds (who will pay them well), to allow research into powerful spells.  Characters can then learn these spells, provided they are a high enough level.\n\nEventually, after many, many hours, the characters may become powerful enough to face any monster in the dungeon, so you might consider then, that you have beaten the game.  Other players might consider that it is time to play a new character, a different race, or a member of different guilds, which offer different skills to the characters, and might repeat the process over and over and over ... of course you could always pay heed to those in the City who may have Missions or Quests, after all, the game does have a storyline that you may be well rewarded by following!\n\nBut, you don't need to go overboard - and remember you have different SP & MP characters, just because your single player party can beat the strongest monster in the dungeon, what's to say there aren't players or parties in MP that can do it without raising a sweat?\n\nIf you HAVEN'T played the game - what on earth are you waiting for?
