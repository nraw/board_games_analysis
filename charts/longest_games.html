The German armies in France had ceased being organized formations and were streaming back to the Reich in willy nilly fashion, hotly pursued by the Western Allied armies as they dashed through Paris and to the borders of Germany. The First US Army (with the Ninth later on), hit the Westwall on September 12th and was destined to slog through the mud and rain for months against the fortifications and surprisingly resilient German reserves hurriedly thrown against them in a desperate bid to keep the American army off as much German soil as possible. Additionally, lack of supply served to further restrain the American advance. Would the war be over by Christmas, or would the Germans pull off a second \u201cMiracle of the Marne\u201d and hold long enough to launch a counteroffensive in the west ?\n\n\n(from Decision Games website:)\n\nHURTGEN: Hell\u2019s Forest is a grand-tactical simulation of that enormous campaign. The 2,240 counters in the game represent almost every formation, at company and battalion levels, which fought in the battle, including US, German, British, and even Belgian units. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider, and headquarters units are all fully represented in the counter-mix. The two map sections are an accurate representation of the battle area and were compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-1944 US Army map sources. The area portrayed shows all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain in relation to their suitability for armor and infantry, along with all the villages, towns and  cities that proved to be the bastions of the German defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn't be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.\n\nTHERE are three main scenarios representing each of the offensive periods of September, October and November. A smaller learning scenario depicts the US 28th Infantry Division\u2019s ordeal as it attempted to drive on the Roer River dams through the forest of the area. Players may also play continuously from September to the first week of December (almost 300 game turns!). The big challenge for the allied player is to see if he can reach the Rhine River months ahead of the actual date, and shorten the war considerably. Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.\n\nTHIS latest edition of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (which began with Wacht am Rhein) presents further refinements to the combat, artillery and supply subsystems in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare at this scale. For example, rules for \u201cLull\u201d periods have been added in order to allow players to speed up game play during periods of relative inactivity. These Lulls compress game play from three turns per day to one, allowing players to cover longer intervals of historic time. Other additions feature level-two entrenchments that allow the German player to create fortified bastions in German towns and cities that can better withstand Allied barrages and ground assaults, along with rules that represent the logistical nightmare faced by the Americans during much of the battle.\n\nTHE orders of battle have been extensively researched in order to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.

Conflicting claims of sovereignty have roiled those \"near seas\" since the Cold War. After decades of patient diplomacy, Beijing's new navy could offer military options for finally asserting sovereignty over prizes within the First Island Chain - that string of islands which runs from the Ryukus south through Taiwan, the Philippines and then curls back to the mainland via Malaysia. BtC presumes that China comes to blows with a Southeast Asian country in a conflict that could expand to possibly include: Australia, India, Japan, the United States as well as a variety of Southeast Asian nations. However, beyond China and one South East Asian nation, the exact composition of opposing coalitions is not predetermined but rather a function of the decisions players make as the game unfolds.\n\nTwo or more people play BtC with two reference cards, dice, and about 350 counters on a 22\" X 34\" map where each hex spans about 70 nautical miles (80 land miles) and each turn represents one day of real time. Players alternate maneuvering air, ground and naval units for up to 14 nations to resolve battles with a universal \"strike\" mechanism that applies across all types of combat; missile defense capabilities are central to survival. Air units represent from 30-90 aircraft each, most ground units are regiments, and naval units are small groups of surface ships/submarines or individual aircraft carriers. Specialized chit play simulates black ops, cyber warfare and various political developments.\n\nBtC is solitaire friendly. The naval operations which dominate play are based on a roll-to-evade model rather than search-to-find model. That means, owing to a battle space awash in electromagnetic emissions, enemy positions - except for motionless submarines - are assumed to be known unless a last-minute dice roll determines a potential target has evaded detection. So there is no \u00e2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u0153hidden movement\u00e2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u009d to stifle solitaire play; and the \u00e2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u0153hidden placement\u00e2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u009d of submarines can be forgone. Finally, the special chits that govern black ops can be played at random to further enable solo game play.\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '180577', 'name': 'Breaking the Chains: Supplements'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2014.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 10.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 86, 'average': 6.65407, 'bayesaverage': 5.54966, 'stddev': 1.62967, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 290, 'trading': 9, 'wanting': 21, 'wishing': 78, 'numcomments': 52, 'numweights': 12, 'averageweight': 3.0833, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10859}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2035}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 2, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '7': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '8': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '9': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '10': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '10+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 86.0, "average": 6.65407, "bayesaverage": 5.54966, "stddev": 1.62967, "median": 0.0, "owned": 290.0, "trading": 9.0, "wanting": 21.0, "wishing": 78.0, "numcomments": 52.0, "numweights": 12.0, "averageweight": 3.0833, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10859}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2035}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 222203, "name": "Napoleon and his Marshals", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rnT_2DTPKWL22KgoVVl_gQ__thumb/img/V4mRh7I76otuYMlBh0XlUGRAC_M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3474640.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rnT_2DTPKWL22KgoVVl_gQ__original/img/g1UmhrkV_QDjGgoAitNXLj3wD54=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3474640.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Napoleonic', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['R.

Italy, 1805-1815).\n\nNapoleon and his Marshals covers 1805-1815 in France and Central Europe. Other expansions are underway that will add the Peninsular War, the Patriotic War in Russia and maps of Scandinavia and the rest of Italy. The game is strategic and operational. Each strategic turn is two months, broken down into 6 10-day operational turns.Forces are division level (5,000 men) per factor, with artillery, cavalry, Cossacks, and guerillas as additional specialized units. Leaders are included at the National Military Leader (Napoleon, Kutusov, etc.), Army commanders, and marshals/corps commanders. Combat units for 11 nations are included. In the expansions the naval war is added, with Nelson, other British Admirals, along with French, Spanish, and Russian admirals, and the navies of those countries and Denmark and Sweden, along with the armies of Spain and Portugal.\n\nThis is the basic game, required to play all other expansions and the campaign game, which will run from January 1805 through the end of 1815 or the final victory. Included is a 31\" x 23.5\" map, printed on plastic coated reinforced \"banner\" paper (which is rolled up for storage), and 5 counter sheets of 88 counters, printed front and back, and slightly larger than traditional counters at 0.6\" square. Map scale is about 28 miles to 38 miles per hex (depending on where you are on the map).\n\nDuring the Strategic Turns, nations collect taxes (production) and expend it on organization and units, including leader activation, replacements, new units, mobilization, sea lift capacity, foreign aid, supplies, and other items. Diplomacy may also occur. During the ensuing 6 operational turns, leaders and units are moved, battles fought, sieges undertaken and possibly diplomacy is conducted.\n\nThere are six scenarios in the game: 1805 (vs Austria, Britain and Russia), 1806-07 (vs Prussia, Britain and Russia), 1805-1807 (vs all four), 1809 (vs Austria, Russia and Britain), 1813-1815 (vs all four), and 1815 (the 100 days of Napoleon's second reign). A player-turn takes about 5-15 minutes, so along with a strategic turn, a full \"season\" (two months is the length of a strategic turn and its associated operational turns) takes about 1.5 - 2.0 hours - less if there are no battles, more if there are many big battles.\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '222211', 'name': 'Napoleon and his Marshals: The Peninsular War'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2017.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 8000.0, "minplaytime": 240.0, "maxplaytime": 8000.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1, 'average': 10.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 9, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 6, 'wishing': 12, 'numcomments': 2, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 1.0, "average": 10.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 6.0, "wishing": 12.0, "numcomments": 2.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5+", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 222211, "name": "Napoleon and his Marshals: The Peninsular War", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KQcyUHPpgEoRIKfZjP2Fpw__thumb/img/7OEPihkz4ZqL5tjVW9Z-TyyUxFE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3743994.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KQcyUHPpgEoRIKfZjP2Fpw__original/img/Mmr18NFtZA461FFzgCPuhKkwoX4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3743994.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": "['Players: Two Player Only Games']", "categories": "['Napoleonic', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['R.

Each nation receives its own box (as named above) of briefing materials. In addition, the Control box contains materials for the instructor to moderate the game.\n\nIn Dangerous Parallel, there are a number of different scenarios.  The one that I played is essentially the same as the Korean War.  Inland invades Outland who are aided by New Zenith.  After a vicious and successful counterattack, the players are asked to make the next move.  Will, for example, Hameel aid Inland, risking nuclear war if Transania becomes involved.\n\nEach country has the following ministers:\n\nChief Minister\nDefense Minister\nPolitical Minister (Minister of Interior, or Police)\nForeign Minister\nForeign Intelligence Minister\nEconomics Minister\nMinister of Information\nSeveral Ambassadors\n\nThere is a requirement that the Foreign Minister is not the Chief Minister to allow for espionage.

It may be played on its own or may be combined with The War: Europe 1939-1945 (\u201cTWE\u201d) to recreate the entire Second World War. In conjunction with The War\u2019s Expansion Kit, gamers can now enjoy the complete TW franchise. The game includes TW: Global rules linking the Asia/Pacific and European theaters.\n\nThe War: The Pacific, 1941-1945 borrows many concepts from TWE, so experienced TWE gamers will readily adapt to TWP\u2019s game system. However, TWP doesn\u2019t just port European Theater rules to the Pacific and hope for the best. The game features sophisticated carrier-warfare rules that capture the unique features of the Allied naval struggle against Japan. Further, TWP isn\u2019t just a naval strategy contest. Unlike some WWII strategy games, Nationalist China plays an active role in TWP, and a player\u2019s diplomatic strategy in China may be as important as his military strategy.\n\nAs in TWE, there are numerous optional rules and variants, from the Doolittle raid to Japanese Fleet suicide missions. Scenarios include Changsha (Nationalist China vs. Japan, Fall 1939); Guadalcanal; Coral Sea; Midway; the Eastern Solomons; Leyte; Okinawa, 1941-1945 Pacific War Campaign; 1942-1943 Turning Point; and TW-Global, combining TWP and TWE into one monster campaign game.\n\nPlaying times range from less an hour for the smallest scenarios up to 40-50 hours for the full campaign. For those who want to run the full Europe-Pacific campaign, joining both games together, you\u2019ll need about 80 hours to recreate all of World War Two.\n\nProduct Information:\n\nComplexity: High (about 8 out of 10)\n    Solitaire Suitability: Good\n    Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 months\n    Map Scale: 1 hex = 46 miles or 75 km\n    Unit Scale: Fleets and Task-Forces; Air: Wings; Land: Divisions, Corps and Army\n    Players: two\n    Playing Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)\n\nComponents:\n\n2 maps\n    8 full sheets of 5/8\u201d counters\n    approx. 20 full color 8.5\" x 11\" cards with various displays, tracks, reminders, tables, charts, worksheets, etc.\n    rules booklet\n    scenario booklet\n    Charts/tables/worksheet booklet\n    deck of variant cards\n    2 dice\n    full color box and lid \u2013 the big 3\u201d deep box\n\nGame Credits:\n\nDesigner: Ernie Copley\n    Developer: Joe Pilkus\n    Artist: Mark Mahaffey\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2021.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 90.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 10, 'average': 8.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.894427, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 96, 'trading': 1, 'wanting': 7, 'wishing': 29, 'numcomments': 11, 'numweights': 4, 'averageweight': 4.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 2, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 10.0, "average": 8.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.894427, "median": 0.0, "owned": 96.0, "trading": 1.0, "wanting": 7.0, "wishing": 29.0, "numcomments": 11.0, "numweights": 4.0, "averageweight": 4.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 37908, "name": "Highway to the Reich: The Allied Airborne Invasion of Holland, 1944 (Third Edition)", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n-oxN7bOguLiD_saH7B5BA__thumb/img/TVczUjmUb9Bj5569GQLBVSsF2q0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic458193.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n-oxN7bOguLiD_saH7B5BA__original/img/AzNxDvKk2f9wK6GyJTiUbiLGiiA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic458193.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "['Highway to the Reich: Operation Market-Garden 17-26 September 1944 \u2013 2nd Edition']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['J.

Over 35,000 men belonging to 1st Allied Airborne Army dropped from the skies of Holland. Their objective: capture and hold a highway. The result: a salient into German territory that lacked only the last objective, and was thus a tragic defeat.\n\nThe 2,000-plus counters detail Brereton's Airborne Corps of three divisions, the units of Brian Horrocks's 30th Corps, and Model's scattered and dishevelled forces at company level for infantry; battery level for artillery, anti -tank and anti-air; and troop level for tank and armored cars.\n\nThe four maps cover the area from the front along the Meuse-Escaut Canal to the land, nearly 200 hexes away, surrounding the Arnhem Highway Bridge. Each map is positioned to cover the operational area of one airborne division. That allows one-division scenarios.\n\nThe system focuses on the interaction of two variables: fire power and morale. The structure of the game turns is simple, with each player turn divided into a Command Communications Phase and a Maneuver Phase. All the activities of each formation are completed before those of another are begun. Attacks proceed with a preliminary barrage, fire attack by maneuver companies, and then close action with tanks or assault troops. All activities involve comparisons of involved units' capabilities. Those variables create the framework within which the players operate.\n\nOptional rules focus on hidden movement and multi-player variations, as well as giving the Allied player the opportunity to execute his own operational plan.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2008.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 1440.0, "minplaytime": 180.0, "maxplaytime": 1440.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 76, 'average': 7.38026, 'bayesaverage': 5.56327, 'stddev': 1.73516, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 361, 'trading': 11, 'wanting': 23, 'wishing': 67, 'numcomments': 53, 'numweights': 14, 'averageweight': 4.2857, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 9741}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1638}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 6, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '4': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 76.0, "average": 7.38026, "bayesaverage": 5.56327, "stddev": 1.73516, "median": 0.0, "owned": 361.0, "trading": 11.0, "wanting": 23.0, "wishing": 67.0, "numcomments": 53.0, "numweights": 14.0, "averageweight": 4.2857, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 9741}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1638}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 165283, "name": "The Dark Sands: War in North Africa, 1940-42", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R6BqQJE6QpvB6FDRpxvbcQ__thumb/img/fPx7-TjrztjGdY2RkKS0_wPPiTs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4410811.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R6BqQJE6QpvB6FDRpxvbcQ__original/img/83MQkOSW0ZlvvnPO1ng2F4ITRUU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4410811.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['History: World War II (Africa)', 'Region: North Africa', 'Series: Dark Valley WWII (GMT)', 'Theme: Deserts']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['Ted Raicer']", "artists": "['Charles Kibler', 'Rodger B.

Cards are included as an optional variant that reflect many of the historical events (e.g. Stillwell's Chinese forces, Japanese night naval proficiency, etc.) that add additional flavor to the game with little additional overhead.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 0.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 2400.0, "minplaytime": 300.0, "maxplaytime": 2400.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 5, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 5.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 22344, "name": "Steel Wolves: The German Submarine Campaign Against Allied Shipping \u2013 Vol 1", "alternative_names": "['Das Boot', 'Das Boot: Der deutsche U-Bootkrieg, 1939-1943']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k_rPzgTziVu0RNIgwfsWyA__thumb/img/Tx9vBiuDIwgsR-OmnmqRAkoUoGU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic919377.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k_rPzgTziVu0RNIgwfsWyA__original/img/qKI1kGziBKrcl-W6lA-U0hDkOHU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic919377.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Players: Games with Solitaire Rules', 'Players: Solitaire Only Games', 'Players: Solitaire Only Wargames', 'Players: Wargames with Solitaire Rules', 'Theme: Submarines']", "categories": "['Nautical', 'Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Area-Impulse', 'Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Movement Points', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Simulation', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']", "designers": "['Stephen C.

Volume I covers the period from the start of the War in 1939 to the early months of 1943. You serve as BdU, Befehlshaber der U-Boote; the Supreme Commander of Uboats, Kriegsmarine. Your mission is to deploy your forces with maximum effect to destroy British and Allied shipping, while limiting your own submarine losses.\n\nFeatured scenarios cover actions ranging from famous short single sub patrols, through short campaigns, ending with the full campaign covering 1939 to 1943. The game map breaks the Atlantic, Mediterranean, South Atlantic, and Western Indian Oceans into historical Operations Areas through which subs patrol in search of shipping.\n\nSpecial rules feature historical events such as the invasion of Norway and Torch; b-dienst, ULTRA, and the intelligence war; torpedo improvements, German wolfpack tactics, Super-Skippers, large vs. small U-boat philosophy, appeals to Berlin for resources, and many others. Every German sub deployed between 1939 and 1943 (as well as some what-if classes) is represented with its very own counter, each meticulously and accurately drawn and shown from their side in full-color. Players familiar with Silent War will find Steel Wolves takes the system to new depths, while those trying it for the first time will be able to quickly get into action!\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '135158', 'name': 'German Fleet Boats'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2010.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 1.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 3000.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 237, 'average': 7.70423, 'bayesaverage': 5.73157, 'stddev': 1.73665, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1006, 'trading': 32, 'wanting': 94, 'wishing': 416, 'numcomments': 123, 'numweights': 56, 'averageweight': 4.1071, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4774}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 412}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 16, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 14, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '1+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 4}}}", "usersrated": 237.0, "average": 7.70423, "bayesaverage": 5.73157, "stddev": 1.73665, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1006.0, "trading": 32.0, "wanting": 94.0, "wishing": 416.0, "numcomments": 123.0, "numweights": 56.0, "averageweight": 4.1071, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4774}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 412}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 69841, "name": "World in Flames Master Edition", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_ZZeQtMZ_U2vM94oDAP7PA__thumb/img/87JrxvoFXLFXn2908XP7RpXPITg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic710626.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_ZZeQtMZ_U2vM94oDAP7PA__original/img/QMD8Qhgmqtn8pV8-BXYQ0Swb_Uk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic710626.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Series: World in Flames (ADG)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "['R\u00fcdiger Rinscheitd']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Looking for a publisher)', 'Australian Design Group']", "description": "(from ADG's website:)\n\nAustralian Design Group is pleased to announce our latest project, World in Flames - The Master Edition, the definitive boardgame of World War II.\n\nSince 1999 R\u00fcdiger Rinscheidt has been working on the Master Edition\u2019s design and development.

A 4x8x4 playing field.  Requires two sets of chess pieces, that even means two kings and two queens.  Each 3D row has alternating colors.  It is ideal to play facing each other along the long span of the board.  The game is intended to naturally extend the 2D-Chess game into 3D.\n\nThe game was inspired by the 3D chess and checker boards depicted on Star Trek.  A 18-page booklet was published in 1970 entitled \"The Complete Rules of Three Dimensional Chess\".\n\nAll aspects of 2D-Chess are retained and extended into 3D, even some things you would not expect like \"Castling\" and \"En Passant\".  However, there is one rule that remains ever unpopular and may seem counterintuitive.  'The Change in Distance Rule' (CID) It states that all diagonal or L-Shaped moves must advance or retreat to or from the opponent.  Yes, players do find it naturally intuitive to move on side-diagonals. But with the rule in place: The Rook nearly stays above the Knight in Piece-Power. Bishops & Knights cannot just move around on their Back-Rank. This eliminates Extra Diagonal 3D King running room and expect a similar game length to regular chess.\n\nTwo-Kings?: The rules were simplified by Robert Jr.  It was very unpopular to have to checkmate both kings.  Therefore, a King-fork, and/or either King being Checkmated wins.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1998.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 20.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 5.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 20694, "name": "Alamein: History's Turning Point 1942", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CVFZfjRoh2mGeURFe4S_lg__thumb/img/T45U04w9MLktxti_d1B9Qe2QsyY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic193802.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CVFZfjRoh2mGeURFe4S_lg__original/img/H2hwKkPHnugwc3OvtFcYUSrfOBw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic193802.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Egypt', 'Players: Two Player Only Games', 'Series: WWII Battles (Avalanche Press)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Michael Bennighof', 'Brian L.

Typically only one unit with a strength chit may combat out of a hex along with all smaller units. Movement and Combat phases with Mobile Assaults for mechanized units during certain situations of movement. CRT for combats keys off the defender's terrain and uses column shifts for extras like air support, combined arms, fortifications, etc. Combat results have some mandatory step losses, but the rest a player's choice on taking step loss or retreating. Advances after combat are along the Path of Retreat for non-mech units, but mech or cav units may deviate. Support Points are used to allow German supply to reach units for mechanized movement and attacks during turn. Support (for Axis attacks) is traced simply a number of hexes to a HQ and then a number of hexes to a road which leads to the source. Supply is just a general trace to a source.\n\nGiven the nature of the covered battles, this game has a shorter playtime and smaller space requirements making it an easier intro into the system used by Fall Blau. Included is a revised Terrain Effects Chart which should ease reference fatigue for either game. An additional map is included which is made to mate with the Fall Blau maps, allowing players to combine the two games into one \"Grand Campaign\" to be played into March 1943.

From June into July, Old Jube swept out of the Shenandoah Valley and across the Potomac River to advance on Washington DC. By threatening the Federal capital, Early and the Confederate command hoped to divert forces from Grant\u2019s Overland Campaign, relieving the pressure on Richmond.\n\nHistorically, Early narrowly defeated Lew Wallace on the Monocacy River, outside of Frederick, MD. However, this \u2018victory\u2019 cost him precious time and manpower. Though he went on to test the outer forts protecting Washington itself (mainly at Fort Stevens), Early was too weak and too late to take advantage of the once-denuded nature of the fortress garrisons.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln quipped, \u201cMr. Early, you are late.\u201d\n\nIn To Take Washington, players first fight the Battle of Monocacy. Their relative success or failure there, as well as their raw efficiency, determines when the Confederates show up on the separate Fort Stevens map. An arrival mere hours earlier than their historical appearance makes an enormous difference in the strength of Union forces manning the defenses, since they had been stripped bare prior to Early\u2019s advance. Conversely, a mediocre showing at Monocacy will present the Confederate player with a very difficult problem at Fort Stevens. Jubal Early couldn\u2019t solve it \u2013 can you?\n\nTo Take Washington covers these two related actions on two separate map areas. One (with two map sheets) covers the Monocacy battlefield while the other (with one map sheet) shows the area around Fort Stevens and a portion of Washington itself.\n\nThe Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series premiered with None But Heroes, covering the Battle of Antietam, and went on to set a new standard of excellence with its presentation of Gettysburg in Last Chance for Victory: The Battle of Gettysburg. The LoB series rules are the pinnacle of over 30 years of development starting with the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series and its follow-on Series: Civil War Regimental Sub-Series (MMP). The LoB system and battle-specific rules incorporate fresh research while discarding the mistaken assumptions and false impressions that have crept into ACW games of the past forty years. Above all, Line of Battle is designed to capture the free-for-all nature of an American Civil War battle in a fun, fast, and very playable format.\n\nScenarios: To Take Washington includes twelve scenarios, with one entry point for the full two-battle Campaign Game. Ten of the scenarios use only one map (either a portion of the Monocacy map set, or the single Fort Stevens map).\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 15-30 minutes\nHex: 110 yards / 100 meters\nUnits: Batteries to Regiments\n\nGame Inventory:\nThree 22 x 34\" full color mapsheets\nThree dual-side printed countersheet (840 1/2\" counters - 267 playing pieces, rest markers)\nOne 36-page Line of Battle Series v2.0 rulebook\nOne 20-page To Take Washington rulebook\nTwo 6-page dual-side printed LoB Charts & Tables v2.0 booklet\nOne single-side printed Terrain Key\nOne Single-side printed Turn Record Track chart\nTwo 6-sided die\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2019.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 3600.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 3600.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 66, 'average': 8.36364, 'bayesaverage': 5.58291, 'stddev': 1.02079, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 441, 'trading': 8, 'wanting': 21, 'wishing': 51, 'numcomments': 29, 'numweights': 9, 'averageweight': 4.3333, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8536}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1132}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '4': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '6': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '6+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 66.0, "average": 8.36364, "bayesaverage": 5.58291, "stddev": 1.02079, "median": 0.0, "owned": 441.0, "trading": 8.0, "wanting": 21.0, "wishing": 51.0, "numcomments": 29.0, "numweights": 9.0, "averageweight": 4.3333, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8536}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1132}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 246825, "name": "TOR: Tales of Resurrection", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/erLkAIJjicMyXh5hMtD3CQ__thumb/img/EVciQQWRPDr1nTd0alqlOchonU8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3990517.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/erLkAIJjicMyXh5hMtD3CQ__original/img/fG74wYy93XHKFqqtZIyv4fKNstc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3990517.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Better Description Needed!', 'Admin: Upcoming Releases', 'Crowdfunding: Kickstarter']", "categories": "['Civilization', 'Economic', 'Fighting']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Cooperative Game']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Self-Published)']", "description": "Tales of Resurrection is a cooperative civilization boardgame for 1-6 players.\n\nTOR is a cooperative Strategy-game in which players must build and develop their settlement in a story-driven campaign.

The new game covers the same time period as the older ones (summer of 1941 to the spring of 1942) but uses a completely new Soviet OB, a new map, and the latest rules for the Europa system.\n\nTotal War gives the Axis player the opportunity to see if he can improve on the massive offensive that pocketed and captured millions of Soviet soldiers. Can you take Moscow or Leningrad? Or are you condemned to suffer the Soviet winter short of victory? The Soviet player must build a strategic reserve large enough to stop the advancing Axis forces and throw them out of Russia. The Soviet player is aided by massive reinforcements that allow him to form new defensive lines in an attempt to slow down or stop the Axis armor thrusts.\n\nTotal War is a historical game on the German invasion of the Soviet Union, from summer 1941 to spring 1942. It charts the titanic struggle of the largest ground campaign in World War II, from the Axis offensives that brought the Germans to the gates of Moscow to the Soviet winter counteroffensive that hurled them back.\n\nTotal War is a two-player game. One side controls the forces of Germany and its allies while the other controls the forces of the Soviet Union. The maps cover Eastern Europe and the western USSR from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, from the plains of Poland to the steppes along the Volga River. Ground units represent corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions. Air units represent groups of 40 to 120 aircraft. Naval units represent task forces of warships.\n\nTotal War is a complete remake and updating of the classic Europa game, Fire in the East. The game\u2019s Soviet order of battle makes extensive use of formerly secret Kremlin information on the Red Army forces that fought the war. The game includes a Soviet order of battle for all of the USSR from 1939 to 1942 and is the more comprehensive game OB ever published on the Red Army in peace and war. The Axis order of battle also is updated, reflecting new research since the publication of Fire in the East. The rules for Total War incorporate the latest rules for the Europa system, with on-demand air power, armor effects, combined arms, and much more, recreating both the German blitzkrieg that captured entire Soviet armies and the Soviet deep operations that nearly splintered the invaders in the depth of the Russian winter.\"\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 0.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 6000.0, "minplaytime": 6000.0, "maxplaytime": 6000.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 15, 'average': 3.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 3.32666, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 25, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 15, 'wishing': 41, 'numcomments': 33, 'numweights': 6, 'averageweight': 5.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 3, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '4': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '6': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '6+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 15.0, "average": 3.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 3.32666, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 15.0, "wishing": 41.0, "numcomments": 33.0, "numweights": 6.0, "averageweight": 5.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 145843, "name": "The Travelers of Triple-G", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pNB3NjnWtehE3_wdS9EtWA__thumb/img/cpbRTXRUUjWgdghvdzIZtPZPeXQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1882072.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pNB3NjnWtehE3_wdS9EtWA__original/img/Ygp75eU14XULH3WAlna3v2wH8_Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1882072.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Open Drafting', 'Role Playing', 'Tile Placement']", "designers": "['Tony Baker']", "artists": "['Tony Baker']", "publishers": "['(Looking for a publisher)']", "description": "The Story\n\nTriple-G is known to many different peoples and creatures by many different names, but most of them know it as the Grey-Green Giant.   It is a very large world located in the Interior of the Expanse, almost directly in the center of Trader's Void.  You would think then that it is a vast hub of activity, given its location, but alas it is not.  You see, for a very very very long time the Gibs and Nowans have slaughtered each other all across the Expanse, and a good-sized majority of that slaughter has happened on Triple-G.  All living things on Triple-G have lived under the constant yoke of their terrible war, until recently... when they vanished!  No one knows why, not that anyone even knows why they were fighting in the first place, but they left Triple-G, and according to rumors, they left the rest of the Expanse as well, and slinked off to their homeworlds to do Void knows what.  And who cares! Because they're gone, it's a miracle, and needless to say, there has been much celebrating.  It is an exciting time to be alive, to be a free person, to be an info collector, to be anyone on Triple-G, but unfortunately we must remember that it is also an ominous time.  Though the Gibs and Nowans have left, they leave behind many vacuums.  Vacuums of space and power that will be quickly filled by the unknown.  Already there are stirrings in the shadows of the townes, and though for the first time in a long long time there are brave travelers heading outside the gates, most never return.

It is primarily a two-player game, although it is possible to have more than one player per side by dividing forces or tasks. The game can also be played solitaire. The game system is inspired in the old Freedom in the Galaxy game from SPI.\n\nThere are two major factions in the game, each controlled by a player. The Stellar Empire owns everything at start, and strives to maintain the status quo through its military might. The Rebel Concordance player owns nothing but a few characters and spaceships at start, but by causing unrest and rebellion throughout the Empire, he hopes to get resources that will allow him or her eventually to meet the Empire on equal terms.\n\nThe game presents you with action at very different scopes. First, you have to administer 50+ planets on a grand-strategic scale, with social, economic and political aspects that are tightly intertwined and can be handled in very different styles.\n\nThen you will be in charge of large military units; starfleets formed by individual starships ranging from tiny fighters to mammoth battlestars, and ground units (legions, brigades and divisions) to slug it out on planet surfaces. War in space is a very complex affair, since you can't establish battle lines or prevent the enemy from hyperjumping to any location on the map\u2026 He who defends everything defends nothing, goes the maxim, and quick response is the key to victory.\n\nFinally, the heart and soul of DWTE are the individual characters. As in all great space adventures, the huge starships may bumble about, but they do not determine the fate of the rebellion saga as much as the astounding contributions of a handful of heroes. The characters perform missions through which they hope to sway the people to join and support their cause, undermine the plans of the enemy and further their own side's goals. During the missions characters face all sorts of dangers, including firefights with lasers blazing against enemy soldiers or monsters, cantina brawls with unruly civilians, getting lost in wormholes, or such everyday occurrences as meteorites falling on your head!\n\nKey Points:\nA grand-scale science-fiction strategy game, which at the same time has a very detailed combat system with individual spaceships and ground military units, and a role-playing aspect with individual characters performing heroic deeds.\n\nThe wide variety of events in the game and the ramifications derived from players' choices and styles of play ensure that no two games will play alike.\n\nIt is a large game with a moderately high level of complexity, but once the rules are learned the game itself flows easily and the on-map counter density is not high.\n\nComponent List:\nFull-color Stellar map\nFull-color Rebel and Imperial Starfleet Displays\nOver 1,400 counters\nOver 200 Character, Item and Stellar Event cards\n4 sheets of Charts and Tables\nCampaign Scenario\n108 page Rules manual\n20-, 10- and 6-sided dice (not provided) are necessary for the PDF version of the game\n\nTarget Audience:\nDWTE appeals especially to SF-buffs with an interest in space adventures and sagas, although its fascinating game system will be interesting and challenging for any gamer. The rules are written in a clear language with extensive explanations and examples of play. They have a logical, easily-referenced order and should not present any special difficulty even for inexperienced players.\n\nGame Formats:\nVirtual Tabletop\nPDF Download\n\nWhat is a Virtual Tabletop Game? \nOur line of Virtual Tabletop games are powered by the Vassal Engine.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2007.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 12000.0, "minplaytime": 1200.0, "maxplaytime": 12000.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 4, 'average': 6.95, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 2.0994, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 17, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 1, 'wishing': 12, 'numcomments': 7, 'numweights': 1, 'averageweight': 4.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 1, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 4.0, "average": 6.95, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 2.0994, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 1.0, "wishing": 12.0, "numcomments": 7.0, "numweights": 1.0, "averageweight": 4.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 191968, "name": "Next War: Poland", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ViI7qG0RQgsoZ1zWU2XdEA__thumb/img/8eKJJgW1oWCuiqc3NLqLduhX6d8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4815157.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ViI7qG0RQgsoZ1zWU2XdEA__original/img/kNBQvGADd2eAVvP_WvV8shefyWk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4815157.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Series: Next War (GMT)', 'Theme: Alternate History']", "categories": "['Modern Warfare', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Gene Billingsley', 'Mitchell Land']", "artists": "['Charles Kibler', 'Mark Simonitch']", "publishers": "['GMT Games']", "description": "Ukraine is in turmoil: embroiled in a civil war which has lasted for years and the situation seems further from resolution with each year that passes. Clandestine support from both Russia and the West fuels the war and keeps any hope of peace at bay. In the meantime, the civil war in Syria and the fight against Islamic extremism gathers steam. NATO and Russia stare each other down in a \"coopetittion\" in the region, and tensions rise meteorically as not so \"friendly\" fire incidents occur. The West tightens sanctions against Russia and ratchets up its rhetoric; Russia, meanwhile, attempting to regain a place in global power politics, responds with sanctions of its own against Turkey and starts low-level cyber warfare and \"little green men\" incidents in the Baltics. Tempers flare across the world, Turkey shoots down another Russian plane while Russian SAM batteries shoot down a Turkish F-16 in retaliation. Russia declares enough is enough, decides on war with NATO, and invades the Baltics and Poland. Belarus, knowing where it's bread is buttered, joins in.  Some NATO nations rush to the rescue while others debate the issue. Once again, Europe trembles to the rumble of tank treads and marching boots\u2026\n\nNext War: Poland, the fourth volume in GMT's Next War Series. This game moves the action from Asia to Europe and allows players to fight a near future war in Poland as the Russians and their allies invade and NATO responds.\n\nOnly a portion of Poland is shown as Ukraine is assumed to be in the midst of a grinding civil war. The Russians are not the behemoth of the Cold War, but they possess good material and a much better trained army. The Baltics may fall quickly, although their forces may put up some resistance and make an appearance as reinforcements, and the front quickly establishes itself in eastern Poland as the Russian 6th and 20th Armies push forward while NATO rushes forces into the area spearheaded by the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and followed up by whatever nation's troops respond to the Article 5 declaration. The question is, can NATO stop the Russians or will Poland be overrun?\n\nNote: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty \"easy to learn\" by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a \"mini-monster game\" experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely \"deliver.\"\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '186021', 'name': 'Next War: Supplement #1'}, {'id': '257385', 'name': 'Next War: Supplement #2 \u2013 Insurgency'}, {'id': '313074', 'name': 'Next War: Supplement #3'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2017.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 212, 'average': 8.1158, 'bayesaverage': 5.72397, 'stddev': 1.59858, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1064, 'trading': 17, 'wanting': 35, 'wishing': 220, 'numcomments': 107, 'numweights': 15, 'averageweight': 4.3333, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4875}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 421}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 3, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 212.0, "average": 8.1158, "bayesaverage": 5.72397, "stddev": 1.59858, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1064.0, "trading": 17.0, "wanting": 35.0, "wishing": 220.0, "numcomments": 107.0, "numweights": 15.0, "averageweight": 4.3333, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4875}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 421}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 36314, "name": "Where Eagles Dare: The Battle for Hell's Highway", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKOeqESsL2Xr5FEnQ7FmLA__thumb/img/UhEUctGmNwvcqPuSLc5JhAiHFDE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic329856.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKOeqESsL2Xr5FEnQ7FmLA__original/img/OjLiSnlZn_OjFHl-FEpI6ZPOtK4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic329856.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Nijmegen (The Netherlands)', 'Country: Netherlands', 'Players: Two Player Only Games', 'Series: Grand Tactical (MMP)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Adam Starkweather']", "artists": "['Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi', 'Steve Paschal']", "publishers": "['Multi-Man Publishing']", "description": "Where Eagles Dare: The Battle for Hell\u2019s Highway is the sequel to The Devil's Cauldron: The Battles for Arnhem and Nijmegen, and completes the Market Garden saga, allowing players to play out the entire operation.\n\nIn addition, Where Eagles Dare is also a complete standalone game, offering a fascinating game situation in which the outnumbered elite 101st Airborne division must race from emergency to emergency - to maintain the vital lifeline to the British 1st Airborne Division fighting for its life in Arnhem.

It is a two-player (or multi-player) strategic / operational wargame of low-to-medium complexity.\n\nUnits in Proud Monster Deluxe are typically divisions with some corps, brigades and regiments also included. Hexes are 20 miles (about 33 kilometers) across, and each turn represents about a 2 week period.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGame system\n\nIn addition to updated graphics, the major changes are Reserves and Reserve Movement phases to simulate the potential for encirclement or defensive reaction. Soviet first winter offensive rules allow the Soviets to retake parts of Russia in early 1942 as happened in history. Both sides now have offensive supply markers to show historical offensive potential and limitations. Innovative weather chits allow for weather variation without extreme weather swings biasing the game. AFV units become even more important due to AFV combat shift. Close Combat option allows for use of an alternate loss procedure and attacker advance to form a jointly-occupied hex, for example, to simulate Stalingrad's gradual fall to the Axis. The ability to fully exploit holes created by mobile assaults is limited to reserves.\n\nThe Axis forces degrade in capability over time while the Soviet forces upgrade in capability. The Axis super heavy artillery Thor and Odin, Heavy Gustav and Dora can fire before combat resolution. Besides the 1941 Free setups, 1941 historical setups are provided for both sides as well as a 1942 scenario. Seasonal offensive rules allow for special turns when special things can happen. The 2 sides show a greater disparity in capability, the Axis can do things the Soviets cannot do and vice versa. Things that work when playing the Axis may not work when playing the Soviets and vice versa.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGame components\n\nGame components have all been improved over the originals. All graphics have been completely updated and upgraded. Counters are 9/16\" and map hexes have ample space to avoid players from knocking over those stacks of counters when the fighting starts to tighten up. The four (4) maps impress upon the players the enormous expanse of the Soviet Union and the challenge for both sides to defend and overcome it. Rules are consolidated from the two original sources into one comprehensive set, with all known errata folded in, and a number of important rule changes to improve game balance and playability. In addition, the development of a definitive set of player aids will keep players playing the game instead of hunting down items in the rules.\n\n4 maps - each map is 22\"x34\" with overlap\n    10 full sheets of 9/16\" counters (2052 counters), printed both sides\n    1 rules book\n    Full color player aid charts and tables cards printed both sides on cardstock\n    2 6 sided dice\n    1 full color box and lid\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2011.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 1500.0, "minplaytime": 1500.0, "maxplaytime": 1500.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 80, 'average': 7.7225, 'bayesaverage': 5.57957, 'stddev': 1.72981, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 395, 'trading': 10, 'wanting': 28, 'wishing': 57, 'numcomments': 63, 'numweights': 18, 'averageweight': 3.6111, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8719}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1191}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 5, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '6': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '6+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 80.0, "average": 7.7225, "bayesaverage": 5.57957, "stddev": 1.72981, "median": 0.0, "owned": 395.0, "trading": 10.0, "wanting": 28.0, "wishing": 57.0, "numcomments": 63.0, "numweights": 18.0, "averageweight": 3.6111, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8719}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1191}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 332402, "name": "Vietnam: 1965-1975", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iMDE4OmhOOyjT6zjP9szQw__thumb/img/ZFuL_ERbwRe2T3U913VgIMThvBw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6426992.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iMDE4OmhOOyjT6zjP9szQw__original/img/vht6iuwr4Dts0p4038zlBmEl3x8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6426992.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Vietnam', 'Players: Wargames with Rules Supporting Only Two Players']", "categories": "['Vietnam War', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "['Vietnam 1965-1975']", "mechanics": "['Simulation']", "designers": "['Nick Karp']", "artists": "['Justin Martinez']", "publishers": "['GMT Games']", "description": "\"This simulation game re-creates the longest, most complex, and least understood conflict in US history in all of its military and political aspects.

Each year is divided into four seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter), and each season has two turns (so, roughly 6 weeks per turn). The map scale is roughly 6 miles per hex and units are, generally, battalions or regiments. During the operational phase, players take turns (who gets to operate is determined by the NLF player) conducting operations with their units to destroy the enemy, clear the roads, take towns and cities, or just reposition units. In the Campaign Game, during Seasonal Interphases, each player decides whether and how many additional units and/or resources to bring in to the fight. The game features hidden VC units, airmobility, riverines, national morale, pacification, ARVN effectiveness, and many other nuances that allow the player to grasp the some of the experience of what it might have been like to conduct the war in Vietnam.\n\nAn updated reimplementation of the Victory Games' classic.\nThis edition changes some of the rules as well as clarifications.

The most obvious change is in scale: hexes are now 3.5 miles across and there are two turns per week (the original had 2.5-mile hexes and four turns per week). This makes for a smaller, faster game that conforms to the scale chosen for Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe and the upcoming games set in Western Europe.

During these turns, the Romans (and Parthians/Sassanids) will create their empire, try to maintain it, and then finally defend it against many incursions.\n\nThe game covers not just the Roman Empire, but the Parthian/Sassanid (Persian) Empire as well, and even one you've probably not heard of: the Kushan Empire. The map covers from Ireland (Hibernia) to India and from Tingis (Morocco) to the lands of the Huns (Kazakhstan) on the 37\" by 18.5\" vinyl-covered map.\n\nUnits are included for all the peoples of Europe and Asia that were involved in the conflicts: the Celts (over 30 tribes), the Germans (tribes, migratory tribes, and Germanic Kingdoms), and over 35 other native peoples. Not only are the Huns included, but the less well-known Hunae (Hephthalites) that moved against the Sassanid Empire are as well. Two complete Roman armies are included on the four 88-counter sheets: the legions and the reformed Roman Army of the later Empire. There's even a counter for the \"Walls of Constantinople\" and counters for the numerous Civil Wars that Rome had. Leadership was important, and the best of the Roman Emperors are included, as well as the best of the Parthian and Sassanid \"King of Kings.\"\n Production is key to success, and the primary economic centers of Europe, Africa, and Asia are shown on the map. Gaining control of these is key to replacing your losses.

The game dates to the 15th century and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the discovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant, if not board game, ever. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves. It was never a popular game; indeed, a single production of half a dozen game sets in the early 17th century was a notable event.\n\nLike other large-board variants, but unlike standard Shogi, the game is played without drops, and uses a promotion-by-capture rule.\n\nTai Shogi is a gargantuan of a game both in terms of strategy and playing time. A serious game of Tai will require several long sessions to complete and may need over 1000 -moves per player. The game is simply too big to be played strategically, and therefore the game typically proceeds as a series of local skirmishes as both players try to develop their pieces and improve their position. Flat out rapid play will typically take at least three days (takes an hour or so to setup!).\n\nWhile most of the 101 different pieces in Tai Shogi are also found in other variants, one unique feature of Tai is the presence right from the beginning of the game of the all powerful Emperors.\n\nTai Shogi is played on a board of 25 x 25 squares and each player has 177 pieces (including 25 pawns) ! A unique feature of Tai Shogi is the presence right from the start of the game of the all powerful Emperors. The Emperor has the greatest power of any piece in any of the Shogi variants as it may move in one turn to almost any square on the board, jumping over any number of pieces of either side in the process.\n\nWhile you might think that the power of the Emperors would have a great impact on the course of the game, their powers tend to offset each other. It should be noted that any otherwise unprotected piece is always protected by its own Emperor.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1500.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 2000.0, "minplaytime": 2000.0, "maxplaytime": 2000.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 6, 'average': 7.16667, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 2.47768, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 7, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 5, 'numcomments': 7, 'numweights': 1, 'averageweight': 5.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 2, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 6.0, "average": 7.16667, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 2.47768, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 5.0, "numcomments": 7.0, "numweights": 1.0, "averageweight": 5.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 236650, "name": "1985: Under an Iron Sky", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/12jMtp0FnPMqeo3_lWT0Zg__thumb/img/pC2MEFPLr_Dedsib-4iuL7gYkC0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3775845.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/12jMtp0FnPMqeo3_lWT0Zg__original/img/ssOS_4MXu86gcOctsMTgkisRZ40=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3775845.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['History: Cold War', 'Theme: Alternate History']", "categories": "['Modern Warfare', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Marco Cimmino', 'Fabrizio Vianello']", "artists": "['Eleonora Olivares', 'Fabrizio Vianello']", "publishers": "['Thin Red Line Games']", "description": "\n\"The increasing destabilization of the political and economic situation in the Soviet Union is undercutting our positions in the world.

Finally Japan opens the struggle for a Pacific Empire of the Rising Sun with its surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. \n Scenarios:\n\nSeptember 1939 \nSince July 1937 a war between Japan and China rages unlike in Europe a mere partisan and guerrilla war. Will the USSR interfere? Will Japan go for the Pacific, or wage a full scale war against China? Or will Japan help the Axis in wearing down the USSR?\n\nJune 1941 \nThe Axis has assaulted the USSR in the ETO. Will Japan join in or stick to its non aggression pact with the USSR? Japan and the USSR have more time to prepare for the inevitable war against each other. Will Japan operate even better than historical? Or will the USA be able to repel the Japanese assaults?\n\nPearl Harbor Dec 1941 \nDecember 7 1941. The Japanese aircraft carrier elite is on its way for a surprise strike against the US Naval base Pearl Harbor, Honolulu, Hawaii. Will the US Navy been crippled for months? At the same time Japan launches a series of Invasions against the Philippines, the Netherlands' East Indies and other important islands. \nWith this infamous attack Japan wakes the industrial giant USA ...\n\nEach of the scenarios can be used as a starting point for a full PTO game till 1945.

From the designer\u2019s website:\n\n\"To Military Assistance Command-Vietnam (MACV), Operation Attleboro was a meeting engagement in War Zone C that grew into the largest operation involving US Forces conducted in South Vietnam at that time.  To the Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN), Operation Attleboro was unexpected early contact by a force attempting to conduct an offensive that snowballed into a desperate defense and fighting withdrawal to protect precious logistic and command capabilities essential to their future operations in III Corps Tactical Zone (III CTZ).\n\nMACV grossly underestimated the National Liberation Front\u2019s (NLF) capability to supply their own forces, tactically maneuver them, and evade detection in order to threaten US/Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) infrastructure and units when operating in close proximity to Peoples\u2019 Liberation Forces of South Vietnam (PLAF \u2013 what are popularly known as \u201cViet Cong Main Force\u201d) base areas in Cambodia.  COSVN grossly underestimated the US\u2019s capability to rapidly reinforce an area of operations using strategic mobility and rapidly employ such reinforcements almost immediately in the field.\n\nMACV underestimated the proclivity of COSVN to use PLAF forces confront and destroy threats to its logistics and supply system.  COSVN erroneously expected US Forces to respond to tactical and operational dilemmas like the ARVN.  To wit, responding to \u201cAmbush and Bait\u201d with dispersed pursuits of the ambushers on multiple axis, thus leaving some pursuing units vulnerable to destruction via \u201cOne Slow, Four Quick\u201d.  Both sides were unaware of flaws and gaps in their respective intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, and the murky picture of active operations that would result from a clash of this magnitude, in the trying terrain of War Zone C.  Neither side gained any lasting advantage from Operation Attleboro, though both sides missed opportunities to secure them.\"\n\nThe game\u2019s scale is Company as the primary unit size, day turns and a mile per hex.  AHDS uses a concealed information/movement mechanism for NLF units and a limited information availability mechanism for both sides, and heavily emphasizes Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and their impact on revealing concealed/limited information units.  The game uses a movement point system and combat result table mechanisms fires, air defense fire and ground combat.  AHDS has an asymmetric component to its turns, as an Initiative player determines the order of resolution of Fires attacks and missions and then Operations (movement and combat).  Within Operations, interactivity and reactions to phasing player action; reaction moves and hasty attacks may be performed by the non-phasing player as the phasing player\u2019s turn is resolved.  Uncertainty is added to victory and even game end in the campaign by the use of Operational Guidance chits which are selected before set up \u2013 neither side may be exactly certain what the other\u2019s priorities are, which impacts victory conditions and player strategy as the game progresses.\n\nAHDS contains 7 scenarios: Introductory, Basic, and Intermediate, ranging from 3 to 10 game turns. The campaign is 25 turns long, but may, through Operational Guidance chit play referred to above, last 30 turns.\n\nAHDS is the first entry in a new series, Campaigns in Vietnam, which features a \u201cGround-Up Build\u201d system.  While sharing core concepts and \u201cDNA\u201d in resolution of play and movement/combat mechanisms, each title is built from the \u201cGround-Up\u201d allowing specific tailoring of concepts and rules mechanisms in an attempt to accurately evoke the very different Campaigns fought during the Vietnam War from 1965-1975 and faithfully incorporate the dynamic changes in force structure and composition, weapons and ISR capabilities, specific operational goals and difficulties, and terrain and regional variances unique to Vietnam and the Vietnam War.\n\nBasic Information\nMap Scale: 1 mile per Hex\nUnit Size: Companies\nTime Scale: One day per Turn.\nPlayers: 2\nComplexity: Medium-High\nSolitaire Suitability: Medium\nPlay by Email Components: Vassal Module completed, available upon game release.\n\nGame Components and Specifications\nGame Map: 22\u201d x 34\u201d    \nGame Counters: 840 each .5\u201d Counters (Three Countersheets)\nRulebook: 50 Pages (Color)\nPlaybook: 50 Pages; contains Scenarios and Campaign, Examples of Play, Designers' Notes, Historical Notes and Tips on Play and Strategy (Color).\nPlayer Aids and Charts: 6 x Double-Sided (Color), 4 x Single Sided (color)\nScenarios and Campaign: Seven Introductory, Basic and Intermediate Scenarios; One Campaign.\nDice: One Ten-Sided Die and Two Six-Sided Dice.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2021.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 11.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 4, 'average': 8.25, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 1.08972, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 5, 'wishing': 35, 'numcomments': 4, 'numweights': 3, 'averageweight': 3.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 3, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 4.0, "average": 8.25, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 1.08972, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 5.0, "wishing": 35.0, "numcomments": 4.0, "numweights": 3.0, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 2880, "name": "C.V.: A Game of the Battle of Midway", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fsg70l1UJMdKFaWp7mmung__thumb/img/XMGJYHncnzipHiG_5kaGwnPjN-k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1165449.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fsg70l1UJMdKFaWp7mmung__original/img/riaB6iY5w2YzxSPCzJR1El0WGEQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1165449.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Better Description Needed!', 'History: World War II (Pacific)', 'Theme: Weather']", "categories": "['Aviation / Flight', 'Nautical', 'Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Critical Hits and Failures', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Simulation', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']", "designers": "['S.

That fleet consisted of more than 5,300 ships carrying over 300,000 men and 50,000 vehicles. Opposing them was Germany\u2019s veteran Wehrmacht.\n\nATLANTIC WALL is a grand-tactical simulation of that campaign. The counters represent almost every formation that participated at the company and battalion level. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, commando, glider and headquarter units are fully represented. Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourg\u2019s fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.\n\nThere are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign. The Amphibious Assault Module is played on a special Beach Display that shows each sub-area of the invasion beaches with units depicted at the company level. It can be played as a solitaire scenario. The campaign game can be played from 6 June to 22 August, with a total of 234 game turns.\n\nThis is the third instalment of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS), the first two being: Wacht am Rhein and Hurtgen: Hells Forest. All three games share a common rules set that\u2019s been extensively updated and revised to simplify game functions while still maintaining the design of the earlier games. In addition to the basic rules, Atlantic Wall includes a set of exclusive rules to cover the special requirements of the amphibious and airborne landings and the logistical system required to support the armies coming ashore.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2014.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 14400.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 14400.0, "minage": 16.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 82, 'average': 8.20915, 'bayesaverage': 5.59035, 'stddev': 1.97325, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 394, 'trading': 7, 'wanting': 21, 'wishing': 118, 'numcomments': 60, 'numweights': 10, 'averageweight': 4.7, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8172}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1015}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 6, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 82.0, "average": 8.20915, "bayesaverage": 5.59035, "stddev": 1.97325, "median": 0.0, "owned": 394.0, "trading": 7.0, "wanting": 21.0, "wishing": 118.0, "numcomments": 60.0, "numweights": 10.0, "averageweight": 4.7, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8172}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1015}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 97826, "name": "The World Peace Game", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pVmvkPg47Jdv8y-xi6sfeA__thumb/img/e2mxj-qbEYSlGBITOx1lyltIW0k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1010199.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pVmvkPg47Jdv8y-xi6sfeA__original/img/fiVMSOG8YGN2LxmB-idoqnnSCEE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1010199.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "[\"Children's Game\", 'Economic', 'Educational', 'Environmental', 'Political']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Cooperative Game', 'Simulation', 'Team-Based Game', 'Voting']", "designers": "['John Hunter']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Self-Published)']", "description": "from the author's website:\n\nThe World Peace Game is a hands-on political simulation that gives players the opportunity to explore the connectedness of the global community through the lens of the economic, social, and environmental crises and the imminent threat of war.

In Spain proper the war, which presented certain aspects of a civil war, saw an uneasy alliance of reformists and traditionalists under the name of \"Patriots\" facing the puppet King Jose I Bonaparte and the occupation army; composed mainly of French but also of Italians, Neapolitans, Poles, Germans, Swiss, Dutch and even Spaniards (known as \"Juramentados\").\n\nSpaniards, British and Portuguese form the Allied side while France and her allies and satellites form the Imperial side. A player (or team) control each side. The game allows to play the war beginning on July 1808 to April 1814, or on several later dates - November 1808,  May 1809, January 1810, January 1811 or February 1812. It is also possible to play only certain parts (e.g. The War in Levante 1809 - 1813),  individual campaigns (Napoleon's 1809) or just battles (Salamanca, Vitoria ...)\n\n\"Tomb for an Empire\" is not just a game it's a whole gaming experience that includes 6 introductory battle scenarios and 18 campaign scenarios of increasing complexity, from Bailen (lasting less than one full turn) to the full campaign starting any year of the war (scenarios 14 to 18).\n\nEl juego est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s pero encontrar\u00e1s en esta p\u00e1gina (Apoyo al Jugador) los archivos en espa\u00f1ol necesarios para jugar \u2013Hojas de Ayuda, Reglas y Escenarios.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2008.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 6000.0, "minplaytime": 20.0, "maxplaytime": 6000.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 92, 'average': 7.34402, 'bayesaverage': 5.55712, 'stddev': 2.14042, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 240, 'trading': 5, 'wanting': 13, 'wishing': 66, 'numcomments': 50, 'numweights': 20, 'averageweight': 3.85, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10225}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1702}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 9, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 6, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 92.0, "average": 7.34402, "bayesaverage": 5.55712, "stddev": 2.14042, "median": 0.0, "owned": 240.0, "trading": 5.0, "wanting": 13.0, "wishing": 66.0, "numcomments": 50.0, "numweights": 20.0, "averageweight": 3.85, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10225}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1702}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 46666, "name": "1914: Offensive \u00e0 outrance", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zRZ-By7CJzsazqVjw12TMg__thumb/img/8VU7u6nyDwn8R2movTXvxMTe1bY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1878177.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zRZ-By7CJzsazqVjw12TMg__original/img/PFbq8Jg4RHo0z1EQbI4X858tU8o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1878177.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Belgium', 'Country: France', 'Country: Germany', 'Country: United Kingdom', 'History: 1914 Guns of August Campaign', 'Series: 1914 (GMT)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War I']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['Michael Resch']", "artists": "['Rodger B.

The map encompasses the entire theater of war from the English Channel to the Swiss Border. The game system used is a streamlined derivative of the 1914, Twilight in the East system, modified to speed play, with care not to lose focus on those aspects of warfare that made the opening stages of WWI so unique. This game system, in conjunction with the accurate map, allows the German advance to be conducted along historical routes with the eminent \u201cOpen Flank\u201d present (instead of units strung out from map edge to map edge). The Allied player has an opportunity to recreate a \u201cMiracle of the Marne\u201d type victory or to stop the Germans earlier. Likewise, the German player has a chance to change history and defeat the Allies\u2019 armies in 1914.\n\nThe Grand Campaign scenario covers the period from the fall of Liege on August 16th to exhaustion at Ypres in mid-November. Two shorter scenarios, The Battle for Lorraine (a learning scenario) and From the Marne to Stalemate are also provided.\n\n1914, Offensive \u00e0 outrance is a playable \u201cMonster Game\u201d designed with the expressed goal that the majority of the game can be completed by four dedicated players in one five-day long Expo. The 24-page rules booklet is concise, well written and organized. The game is exciting and gives wonderful insights into one of the most important campaigns of the twentieth century. The result is that 1914, Offensive \u00e0 outrance is a game that the \u201cWW1 enthusiast\u201d must have and that a gaming connoisseur will enjoy.\n\nTime Scale: Game turns vary between two and four days in length.\nMap Scale: Eight kilometers per hex.\nUnit Scale: Division/Brigade.\nNumber of Players: one to many (well suited for four players).\n\nGame Designer: Michael Resch\nResearch and Design Assistance: Rian van Meeteren\nDeveloped by: Dick Vohlers\nMap Design Assistance: S.

These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world\u2019s best to the world\u2019s worst.\n\nBurma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.\n\nWhile mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the \"cool stuff\" too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply, elephant and oxen transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.\n\nUnlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).\n\nScenario Info:\n\n    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns\n    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns\n    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns\n    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns\n    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns\n    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns\n    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively\n\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1/2 week\nHex: 5 miles / 8 Km\nUnits: Battalion to Division\n\nGame Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):\nTwo 22 x 34\" full-color mapsheets\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2\" counters)\nOne 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet\nOne 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet\nTwo 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts & Tables booklets\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\nPlayers: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)\nPlaying Time: 1 to 60 hours\nComplexity: High\nSolitaire Suitability: Moderate\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1999.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 0.0, "playingtime": 3600.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 3600.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 338, 'average': 7.87093, 'bayesaverage': 5.8429, 'stddev': 1.38543, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1282, 'trading': 27, 'wanting': 62, 'wishing': 164, 'numcomments': 189, 'numweights': 53, 'averageweight': 4.0189, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3644}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 210}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 13, 'results': {'0+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 9, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 338.0, "average": 7.87093, "bayesaverage": 5.8429, "stddev": 1.38543, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1282.0, "trading": 27.0, "wanting": 62.0, "wishing": 164.0, "numcomments": 189.0, "numweights": 53.0, "averageweight": 4.0189, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3644}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 210}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "0+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 3233, "name": "Against the Reich", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OEFbQYgBI5UU4D8X47oOwA__thumb/img/_FjFT_C-E7f-EyC48l_Sypahv10=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic432472.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OEFbQYgBI5UU4D8X47oOwA__original/img/z3dQVKwdlxWchBc5MEzM5VxhLnU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic432472.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Players: Two Player Only Games']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Action Points', 'Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Joseph M.

The campaign game covers the Konrad Operations (I, II, and III) in January 1945. There are scenarios for each of the Konrad Operations as well as Operation Southwind in February and Operation Spring Awakening in March 1945.\n\nIn the final months of the war, Germany was still full of fight and believed Budapest to be the key to turning the tide. With Budapest fully surrounded by Soviet and former-Axis Romanian forces, the situation in the city was desperate. The Germans devised a plan to relieve Budapest by bringing in the SS-Totenkopf and SS-Wiking Panzer Divisions from Poland to launch a surprise attack before the Soviets closed the ring on the trapped forces in the city. Launched in the wee hours on New Year's Day, 1945, the fate of the Axis hung in the balance. The Soviets, having campaigned continuously from the summer of 1944, fought back viciously and showed their mettle against the elite SS Panzer Divisions.\n\nA great proportion of the armored forces for both sides funneled into the Budapest area. All but one of the seven SS Panzer Divisions and half of the Heer Panzer Divisions on the Eastern Front (a full third of all Panzer Divisions total) ultimately fought here. The Soviets committed three Tank, five Mechanized, and one Cavalry Corps to blunt the Axis drive. The battlefield became a graveyard of tanks.\n\nThe game showcases late-war equipment like the Tiger II, Brummba\u00cc\u02c6r, IS-2, and ISU-152 while also including unique units like Cavalry, Assault Pioneers, Soviet Naval Infantry, Hungarian SS, and ad hoc forces mobilized to defend Budapest. Rules covering Danube River crossing, Urban combat, redeployment deception (Maskirovka), and Festung rules highlight this unique and often misunderstood campaign.\n\nScenarios:\n\n            The Taking of Budapest 123: Full Campaign (4 maps, 26 turns)\n            Operation Konrad I & II (2 maps without Budapest, 10 turns)\n            Operation Konrad I (2 maps without Budapest, 5 turns)\n            Operation Konrad II (1 map without Budapest, 5 turns)\n            Battle for Zamoly (Part of 1 map, 5 turns)\n            Operation Konrad III (2 maps, 10 turns)\n            Battle for Koma\u00cc\u0081rom (Part of 2 maps, 17 turns)\n            Days of Battle: Opening Blows to Koma\u00cc\u0081rom (Part of 2 maps, 4 turns)\n            Operation Southwind (Part of 2 maps, 8 turns)\n            Operation Spring Awakening (2 maps, 10 turns)\n\n\n \nComponents:\n\n            BCS rulebook (v2.0, in full color)\n            Two BCS Charts and Tables (v2.0, in full color)\n            BCS Support rulebook (v2.0, in full color)\n            PLS Game Specific rulebook\n            Axis Player Booklet\n            Soviet Player Booklet\n            Turn Record Track Card\n            Axis Player Display Card\n            Soviet Player Display Card\n            Last Blitzkrieg Addenda sheet\n            Four 22\u201d x 34\u201d Full Color Game Maps\n            1,680 Counters (four sheets of units and two BCS marker sheets)\n            10 scenarios total, 2 one-map scenarios, 4 are 5 turns or less\n            Box and Dice\n\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2021.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1560.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 1560.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 64, 'average': 9.02344, 'bayesaverage': 5.6039, 'stddev': 1.00168, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 362, 'trading': 3, 'wanting': 23, 'wishing': 70, 'numcomments': 30, 'numweights': 5, 'averageweight': 3.6, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 7556}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 861}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 64.0, "average": 9.02344, "bayesaverage": 5.6039, "stddev": 1.00168, "median": 0.0, "owned": 362.0, "trading": 3.0, "wanting": 23.0, "wishing": 70.0, "numcomments": 30.0, "numweights": 5.0, "averageweight": 3.6, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 7556}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 861}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 259488, "name": "La Bataille de Deutsch-Wagram 1809", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ROJB52n1moKGs7BsAtbsBA__thumb/img/yd4xstmFiVbsUVG_VZ3p_ghzAY8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4425622.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ROJB52n1moKGs7BsAtbsBA__original/img/pAqhNMbJMtRJOBeibJ9grjUKLBs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4425622.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Deutsch-Wagram (Austria)', 'Series: La Bataille (Clash of Arms Games)']", "categories": "['Napoleonic', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "['La Bataille de Deutsch-Wagram']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['James Soto', 'Dennis A.

Parker']", "artists": "['Ilya Kudriashov']", "publishers": "['Compass Games']", "description": "Hitler's Last Gamble, Designer Signature (2nd) Edition is Danny Parker's final effort to create a memorable game on the Battle of the Bulge. The scale is conventional: 2 miles per hex, battalions and regimental units; two turns per day. However, the game has many innovations never before seen. Day and night turns differ dramatically both with respect to movement and the likelihood of decisive combat. All units are rated for Morale which can often be more important than combat strength. Forced marches and fluid zones of control at night are a major German offensive weapon while the Allied air effort influences German movement. The game has many previously unseen influences: V-1 weapons attacks, weather impacts on combat (and even zones of control) and bridge discovery.\n\nAs you would expect from a Danny Parker game the Order of Battle for both sides has been exhaustively researched (evaluated in a detailed numerical fashion) and several new units and many changes to others. Besides the new morale rules, armor superiority from the original has been retained although combined arms is enhanced and artillery influences are significantly changed. There are many changes to movement based on weather conditions.\n\nThe map in the original game included all of the villages in the Ardennes. The new map now includes not only those villages but also all the hamlets and castles. A study of the 1940 census has resulted in some towns being downgraded to villages and some village upgraded to towns. The contour lines in the original game are now gone and severe terrain has been added based on detailed evaluation using Google Earth. The map has been expanded to include more area in both the north and south. There are three maps with one smaller one devoted to the Battle Before the Meuse scenario\nThe Game Booklet includes scenarios, Designer\u2019s Notes, Game Variants, Examples of Play and the Game as History. Also included is a Historical Background Booklet with Historical Analysis and Summary, Detailed Orders of Battle, Evaluation of Combat Strengths in the Ardennes and Design Bibliography. With more detailed historical background than any game to ever see print, HLG will also be a great reference tool.\n\nMore than just a reworking of the original game, this version is really a brand new game that has seen constant work for nearly five years by a dedicated team. The research on every aspect of the game has been truly monumental.\n\nOf course there never will be a 'last word' in Bulge games, the subject is far too popular. But this game pushes the envelope far forward.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\nCOMPONENTS:\nTwo 34x22\" map sheets and one 25x21\" map sheet\nSix countersheets (5/8\" size); 1032 counters (582 are ground/air units)\nRules booklet\nHistorical Study booklet\nGame Booklet with scenarios, variants & designer notes\n9 two sided player aid cards (18 pages)\n6 scenario cards (11 pages)\n38 Order of appearance card displays for Allied and German ground and air elements\nTwo six-sided dice\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2022.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 4800.0, "minplaytime": 180.0, "maxplaytime": 4800.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 3, 'average': 9.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.816497, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 6, 'wishing': 25, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 5, 'averageweight': 4.2, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 3, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 3.0, "average": 9.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.816497, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 6.0, "wishing": 25.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 5.0, "averageweight": 4.2, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 6203, "name": "Enemy at the Gates", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tKdyKh_NLg5ikxzRXqAiPQ__thumb/img/0GiaiHXyV7JaGAmdP_dwq_fdUzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic40442.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tKdyKh_NLg5ikxzRXqAiPQ__original/img/iwcHsFnmvcCfrU9Yl5ncquiSlKU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic40442.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Kharkov (Ukraine)', 'Country: Russia', 'Country: Soviet Union', 'Country: Ukraine', 'Series: Operational Combat Series (MMP)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "['Case Blue']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Dean Essig']", "artists": "['Dean Essig']", "publishers": "['The Gamers']", "description": "On a cold, foggy morning in November, 1942, a four-hour artillery barrage rocked the Rumanian lines north and south of Stalingrad.

Each session can last as long as you want. When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play solo or with friends throughout your campaign. It's easy to swap players in and out at will. Your goal is to find at least fourteen totems hidden throughout the world.

Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward.\n\nSleeping Gods is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters.

Ordnance weapons are developed through technology research and expended during play to improve combat options.\n\nThe British player will enjoy the 20,000lb Grand Slam earthquake bomb \u2013 an excellent weapon for taking out German factories, shipyards and airfields.  British ships will can arm themselves with Fairey-Stooge anti-kamikaze missiles and \u201cUnrotated Projectile\u201d anti-aircraft weapons.  The homeland\u2019s factories and bases will enjoy increased protection from the Z-Battery AA rocket system.  British aircraft will find targets easier using RP-3 air-ground rockets.\n\nJapan will find itself with new kamikaze weapons: the Ohka \u201cCherry Blossum\u201d jet, Shinyo Suicide Boat and Kaiten Human Torpedo are powerful weapons for Japan to increase its kamikaze capacity and defend its shores.   The A-11 ICBM and Fu-Go incendiary balloon bomb (designed to float across Pacific air currents) can both strike America from Tokyo!\n\nThe dizzying array of new weapons for Britain and Japan will add untold new strategy options and realism to Global War!\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[{'id': '188364', 'name': 'Global War 1936-1945 (Second Edition)'}, {'id': '258347', 'name': 'Global War 1936-1945 (Third Edition)'}]", "yearpublished": 2016.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 9.0, "playingtime": 1080.0, "minplaytime": 360.0, "maxplaytime": 1080.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '7': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '8': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '9': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '9+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "9+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 211318, "name": "Global War 1936-1945: Champions of Freedom", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-4RqYYS0iMrKfSYSK7TONQ__thumb/img/AfWXspvD2_EkJj3Nbdl41I1YiH4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4262236.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-4RqYYS0iMrKfSYSK7TONQ__original/img/jXy4xAJDFEuOP3ZIJblTBeW3A_I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4262236.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Expansion for Base-game', 'Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['Will Henson']", "artists": "['David Prieto']", "publishers": "['Historical Board Gaming']", "description": "Late in the war the United States developed a number of advanced weapon designs, many of which never made it past the prototype stage.

You can find small games that might only take 30 minutes to play, but you can play it multiple times, playing for the best of three or best of five. Other games could be described as monster games that will literally take a very long time.\n\nA key feature of the system is its simplicity. They games are designed for people that have a penchant for moving the counters about and not having to wade through large rule sets. Further, as the games are mostly situational, ie not operational, lines of supply and command are not critical, although some games do offer leader units and there are leader rules. The game has been designed to be failsafe from the ground up. This means you just move the counters about, observing movement allowances and terrain etc, but if you don't understand surround rules or terrain defence effects, its not that important, just play anyway. But if you want to tighten things up, there is a deep set of mechanics, including unit mix/matching, that is gaining a bonus for armour versus infantry stacks with no armour or mechanised etc.\n\nThe game includes all unit types including air and sea units with a wide range of additional units types for air defence, insurgents and irregular activity.\n\nThe scenarios are all historic and players are encouraged to learn their history and to even criticise the orders of battle and terrain arrangements as doing so is only further developing your own historical understanding and helping the War Blog team to help other people similarly.\n\nThe scenarios also encompass current events, so if you have an interest in following world events you can use War Blog to do so.\n\nMany of the scenarios included are largely unstudied and certainly not common knowledge, and this whole library of scenarios is always on the increase with scenarios being updated with new intelligence and new scenarios added.\n\nThe game is currently under development and the rule set could well branch out to encompass features not covered on the online version which can readily be added to a paper based procedural rule set, for example, hidden movement and political intervention. Further, experienced players are encouraged to add their own rules up.\n\nMany of the scenarios are unbalanced and there mainly for situational analysis, for example, in a educational environment. However, even in situations where a player might not stand a chance of winning, players can set house scoring based on how long a player could hold out and how they play in comparison to the historical timeline.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2015.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 20.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1, 'average': 9.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 1, 'numcomments': 2, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 1.0, "average": 9.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 1.0, "numcomments": 2.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 294585, "name": "1985: Deadly Northern Lights", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V-LeKaFFxLPzBGD3Jc1GSw__thumb/img/ChIZRKVYArNz6t81XGvMOAVwPoQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5062321.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V-LeKaFFxLPzBGD3Jc1GSw__original/img/G2Ay1aYI9O2WujUrg03jG30pQ4Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5062321.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Denmark', 'Country: Finland', 'Country: Norway', 'Country: Sweden', 'Theme: Alternate History']", "categories": "['Modern Warfare', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Ratio / Combat Results Table', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation', 'Variable Set-up', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Fabrizio Vianello']", "artists": "['Fabrizio Vianello']", "publishers": "['Thin Red Line Games']", "description": "\n\"The waters of the Barents Sea are constantly violated by nuclear armed US submarines and carriers.\nNordic Countries must realize that their tacit consent plunges them into the strategic balance between United States and the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics.\"\n\nPublic Declaration of State Committee on the State of Emergency in the U.S.S.R.\nMoscow July 24, 1985\n\n\n\"1985: Deadly Northern Lights\" covers the Warsaw Pact offensive against the Nordic countries during the dramatic events of World War Three.

In the \"Open-Mode\" configuration of this simulation each Team has a wall-mounted 1:50k planning map and the Simulation is played out on a table-mounted 1:25k map, divided into 2x3' sectors (roughly 10ft. across and 12ft. between the Divisional commanders). Each side has 3 Div. Commanders; 3 Artillery Commanders, 2 Operational Leaders; an Overall Commander; and an Operational Aide (22 people in total). To run the run the \"Closed-Mode\" a total of 55+ people are required. In the \"Closed\" version the Commanders are in a separate room from the Simulation and have status updates conveyed by written notes of brief, one-way, phone messages. HO scale miniatures (Roco) are typically used in the \"Closed\" version, so that limited \"Aerial\" photos (or sketches) can be requested. Combat is resolved through Dice-Rolling in a fashion similar to most commercial wargames of the era.\n\nThis is obviously more than your typical war-game, but it is a streamlined version of actual military simulations used by the US Army in the 1970's.\n\n\u2014user summary\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1979.0, "minplayers": 22.0, "maxplayers": 100.0, "playingtime": 6000.0, "minplaytime": 2880.0, "maxplaytime": 6000.0, "minage": 18.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1, 'average': 7.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 3, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '7': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '8': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '9': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '10': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '11': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '12': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '13': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '14': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '15': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '16': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '17': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '18': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '19': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '20': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '21': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '22': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '23': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '24': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '25': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '26': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '27': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '28': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '29': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '30': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '30+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 1.0, "average": 7.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "30+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 369429, "name": "UltraQuick College Softball", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VZ_5eB1SvWnjtQos18tj5Q__thumb/img/9KBjhFhTk1QYuHsWvBGCkoWsovg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7031155.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VZ_5eB1SvWnjtQos18tj5Q__original/img/sTOVi3XD2wfK-i2wtwhZw-CTssc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7031155.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": "['Players: Solitaire Only Games', 'Sports: Baseball']", "categories": "['Expansion for Base-game', 'Dice', 'Sports']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']", "designers": "['Jeff Downey']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['Downey Games']", "description": "This E-Book contains every college softball team in Divisions I, II and III, plus the NAIA.

One player plays the Germans and their allies (the Axis) and the other plays the Soviets. While paper and cardboard cannot possibly simulate a large-scale war, this game does attempt to model some of the significant aspects of the conflict, and also give the players an idea of the problems their historical counterparts faced.\n\nMasahiro Yamazaki has long been considered the East Front specialist in Japan. His games - including the excellent Stalingrad Pocket by the Gamers - have been enjoyed by English gamers since 1992. Now, for the first time, MMP is very proud to present his ultimate vision of the War in Russia. With over 10 years of development and expertise, Masahiro has culled all of his talents to give you the finest game on the entire Eastern Front of World War Two.\n\nRed Star Rising is part of the International Games Series (IGS) from Multi-Man Publishing (MMP). Using a variant of the popular Victory in the West chit pull system, but with some very novel twists, Masahiro presents the theater as never before. If the Soviet player can weather the Nazi storm, she will rise from the ashes and become the powerful enemy that defeated Germany.

In November 1914, Russia's 3rd Army pressed on Krakow, the center of Austrian Poland, while the Russian 8th Army threatened to break through the Carpathian passes into Hungary.  Desperate to relieve the pressure, Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, Chief of the General Staff for Austria-Hungary, gambled on a counter attack about 25 miles southwest of Krakow.\n\nConrad launched his 4th Army into the thinly held, 20-mile wide gap between the Russian 3rd and 8th Armies on December 3.  Austro-Hungarian forces rolled forward about 12 miles in just three days along a front from Lipanow in the north to Limanowa in the south.  Russian resistance stiffened on the 6th with fierce fighting erupting around the village of Limanowa.  Several days of see-saw action ensued until the lines crystallized on December 11.\n\nFor once, Conrad's daring paid off.  In response to his gains, the Russians scrambled to secure their front and so abandoned plans to drive on Krakow and Hungary.  Conrad, however, paid a heavy price by suffering 12,000 casualties and expending the last of his elite 14th \"Innsbruck\" infantry corps to stop the Russians who easily absorbed and replaced their 30,000 losses.  Never again would the Austro-Hungarian Army win an independent victory; from now on, all progress depended on German participation.\n\nLLL is the second volume in the Red Poppies Campaign (RPC) system for gaming World War I battles.  Ownership of volume one, The Battles for Ypres, is NOT required to play LLL; everything you need to play LLL is in this box.  LLL offers the same rules as The Battles for Ypres except that section 12, the Ypres scenarios and campaigns, is intentionally left blank while section 13, the Limanowa scenarios and campaigns, has been added.\n\nLLL offers a map of the Limanowa battlefield scaled at 200 meters per hex.  Game play proceeds in interactive turns representing 10 minutes of real time each as players maneuver opposing cavalry and infantry companies across a rugged rural landscape typical of the Carpathian foothills.\n\nProduct Information\n\n\u2022 Complexity:                 6 out of 10\n\n\u2022 Solitaire suitability:      8 out of 10\n\n\u2022 Time Scale:                 10 minutes per turn\n\n\u2022 Map Scale:                  200 yards per hex\n\n\u2022 Unit Scale:                 Companies, squadrons, sections\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2018.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1440.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 1440.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 25, 'average': 7.516, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 1.33796, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 218, 'trading': 4, 'wanting': 14, 'wishing': 33, 'numcomments': 20, 'numweights': 1, 'averageweight': 2.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 1, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 25.0, "average": 7.516, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 1.33796, "median": 0.0, "owned": 218.0, "trading": 4.0, "wanting": 14.0, "wishing": 33.0, "numcomments": 20.0, "numweights": 1.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 322220, "name": "War for America: The American Revolution, 1775-1782", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e0pAo8GbZN8m37r1f-TehQ__thumb/img/qcjhNs2_UooGo_G1xL8yoU6sMF8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5720107.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e0pAo8GbZN8m37r1f-TehQ__original/img/kT2Ei-MorPkMW2HEKjv4qbR8urc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5720107.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Upcoming Releases', 'Country: USA', 'Players: Wargames with Rules Supporting Only Two Players']", "categories": "['American Revolutionary War', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Point to Point Movement']", "designers": "['Gilbert Collins']", "artists": "['Knut Gr\u00fcnitz']", "publishers": "['Compass Games']", "description": "War for America: The American Revolution, 1775-1782 is a strategic game based on the events during the American Revolution. It is a 2 player game that shows how the conflict, which began as a \u2018civil war\u2019 turned into a World conflict with a Great Britain that was greatly isolated. It features a new \u2018Action Pulse\u2019 and \u2018Initiative System\u2019 that keeps every turn of variable length and new. Game design by Gilbert Collins.\n\nThe Colonial player must build a \u2018Continental Army\u2019 to battle with the British in order to prevent any sister colony from being overrun. This is going to take time and he must \u2018hold on\u2019 and try to defeat a major British force, to impress the old enemies of Great Britain.\n\nThe game is played at the Grand Strategic level and each strength point equals 1,000 men or less. Players will assemble forces to seize control of colonies and regions. When French recognition is achieved, during 1778, an entire new dimension is added to the conflict. France, Spain and the Netherlands will bring fleets into the waters of North America and the Caribbean, challenging Britain\u2019s mastery of the seas.\n\nThe game utilizes the popular \u2018point to point\u2019 movement system but more carefully modelling the geography of North America. This is done by enhancing the movement of armies along the important water shed basins. Armies are not destroyed in single combat as many past games have shown, but will demonstrate realistic casualty figures with prevalent retreat and disruption results.\n\nWar for America attempts to show the conflict from the British perspective and how a \u2018rebellion\u2019 turned into a World War. Great Britain is alone, without allies, but the Colonies don\u2019t have it easy either. Despite their inexperience and individual identities, they must come together to create and maintain a Continental army. This is a \u2018large game\u2019 but also contains a shorter scenario starting in 1778, taking about half the time to play.\n\nProduct Information:\n    Complexity: Medium\n    Time Scale: Seasonal turns (6 turns per year)\n    Map Scale: Area point-to-point map\n    Unit Scale: 1,000 men per strength point, individual capital ships, and leaders\n    Players: 2\n    Solitaire: Medium/High\n    Playing Time: 8 hours (15+ hours for Campaign Game)\n\nComponents:\n    2 Map sheets\n    2.5 Countersheets of 9/16\" and 5/8\" unit-counters (432 counters total)\n    6 Player Aid Cards\n    1 Sequence of Play Card\n    2 Army Organization Displays\n    1 Setup Card\n    51 Action Cards\n    1 Rulebook\n    1 Playbook\n\n-description from publisher's website\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2022.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 480.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 16.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 31, 'average': 6.34194, 'bayesaverage': 5.50716, 'stddev': 2.81949, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 181, 'trading': 5, 'wanting': 9, 'wishing': 57, 'numcomments': 30, 'numweights': 3, 'averageweight': 3.3333, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 17965}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 3349}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 1, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 31.0, "average": 6.34194, "bayesaverage": 5.50716, "stddev": 2.81949, "median": 0.0, "owned": 181.0, "trading": 5.0, "wanting": 9.0, "wishing": 57.0, "numcomments": 30.0, "numweights": 3.0, "averageweight": 3.3333, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 17965}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 3349}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 188934, "name": "Dungeon Hack: Dungeon Adventure", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6a9LGJ6v-5rGoGPRSqk6sA__thumb/img/RUR4wVXcJIix2dsiqd7OZzEeros=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2795579.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6a9LGJ6v-5rGoGPRSqk6sA__original/img/wAOWKGQcYX4hewXpC-FB_7XnKOI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2795579.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Print & Play']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement']", "designers": "['Joseph Propati']", "artists": "['Joseph Propati']", "publishers": "['(Web published)']", "description": "Dungeon Hack: Dungeon Adventure is the ultimate dungeon crawl! It combines true elements of D&D table top roleplaying using ver3.5 Dungeons and Dragons rules with a versatility of a card game dungeon crawl. If you\u2019ve ever played the original computer version of Dungeon Hack and loved the endless possibilities, then this is the game for you. It allows for solo or CO-OP play within a randomly generated multi-level dungeon. Just like in the computer game, you explore a never ending dungeon with monsters, treasure, traps, and glory! It\u2019s you against the dungeon and everyone is out to get you! Dungeon Hack uses actual monsters, traps, treasures and equipment directly from the Dungeon and Dragons universe. Story lines and game play is taken from actual D&D modules! If you\u2019ve wanted to play D&D but couldn\u2019t find the group, well look no further\u2026 Dungeon Hack is here! You create actual characters with abilities that you will use during your adventure. All the while you earn experience and fortunes to help level up and grow your character to much stronger and higher levels.\n\nDungeon Hack: Dungeon Adventure is a solo D&D game on a micro level using 4\u201dx4\u201d tile cards representing dungeon rooms, corridor rooms, corridors and junctions while colored cubes represent your characters and the ever increasing monsters. A multitude of cards depict and define the monsters, treasures, encounters, and obstacles you will face within the dungeon.\n\nMost D&D rules apply, with many of the mundane and complicated rules left out to create a smoother and more stream lined game play.\n\nThe goal is to descend each level facing new encounters that will bring you face to face with puzzles, doors, traps, monsters and treasures at every turn. Before every two levels you will have a QUEST card that depicts special requests for the town asking for specific items you can find during your adventures through the levels of the dungeon.

No game tells the story of World War II in Europe like Totaler Krieg!\n\nThis new edition of our popular Krieg! game is still the same highly playable, unpredictable and enjoyable experience it always has been. What\u2019s new is a design and graphic update and expansion to give you more options -- especially if you want to explore the critical pre-war period from 1937 to 1939. What if the Republicans had won the Spanish Civil War? What if Germany and Russia hadn\u2019t signed their Non-Aggression Pact? What if France had modernized its army instead of building the Maginot Line? All of these options are literally in the cards that form the strategies of the three factions -- Axis, Soviet Allies, and Western Allies.\n\nBest of all, Totaler Krieg! can be linked with its new Pacific companion game, Axis Empires: Dai Senso!, to play the joint Axis Empires scenario, an eye-opening global look at all of World War II. The fate of the world is in your hands!\n\nTotaler Krieg means Total War in German. In the game, play moves from Pre-War (where players mobilize their forces and engage in diplomacy) to Limited War (when open conflict begins) to Total War -- at that point, it\u2019s all-out warfare

It is a game of high interactive play where both players have a set of ten operation points and a number of supply dumps. \nBy spending operations points you will be able to perform different, mostly non-combat, actions. By expending a supply dump you will also be allowed to perform combat missions. But there will be a limited number of supply dumps to expend and they will also be needed to keep units in supply. When you spend operation points you will only be allowed to spend one, two or three points in a row before it is your opponents turn to spend his.\n\nThis creates a game where you, in the long term, will have to plan and save supply and at the same time be prepared to react to your opponent's actions. \nIn the short term you will be forced you make decisions based upon the number of operation points you have been given to spend in a row and the missions you need to accomplish.\n\nContents:\n\n    22\" x 34\"  map    \n    352 each .6\" Game Counters\n    24 pages rulebook\n    4 ea. 8 1/2\" x 11\" Charts\n    3 ea. 8 1/2\" x 11\" Information\n\n\n5 Scenarios + Campaign Game\n\nMap Scale:    12.5 miles per hex\nUnit Size:    Regiments / Battalions\nTime Scale:    1 month per turn\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2012.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1800.0, "minplaytime": 240.0, "maxplaytime": 1800.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 147, 'average': 7.80952, 'bayesaverage': 5.63479, 'stddev': 1.38507, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 574, 'trading': 7, 'wanting': 29, 'wishing': 110, 'numcomments': 80, 'numweights': 17, 'averageweight': 3.4118, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6574}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 779}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 5, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 147.0, "average": 7.80952, "bayesaverage": 5.63479, "stddev": 1.38507, "median": 0.0, "owned": 574.0, "trading": 7.0, "wanting": 29.0, "wishing": 110.0, "numcomments": 80.0, "numweights": 17.0, "averageweight": 3.4118, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6574}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 779}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 33565, "name": "Master Europa 101: Eastern Front", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b2FOMol4x_lenDN3Oypm2A__thumb/img/fl3eaI59HmmNIqYL_ppVXtAC_Rk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4286108.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b2FOMol4x_lenDN3Oypm2A__original/img/RhuTUZEnat4qdYjjKClMS9e0K70=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4286108.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": "['Players: Two Player Only Games', 'Series: Master Europa']", "categories": "['Expansion for Base-game', 'Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Tom Johnson']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['Master Europa']", "description": "Master Europa is a complete set of rules and charts replacing those in the games of the Europa series.\n\nThis module covers the games \"Fire in the East\", \"Scorched Earth\", and \"Urals\".

You'll find airships, exotic floating tombs, deeper levels of the white vaults, and even other worldly locations.\n\nMINIATURES & MONSTERS\nThe story continues as you take your characters into even higher levels of power and face off against even more dangerous and diverse creatures!\nNew weird creatures inhabit the world. Learn their lore, learn their weaknesses, and kill them.\n\nMORE CRAWL MODE OPTIONS\nEach Adventure Expansion contains a set of unique Crawl Mode adventures to play when you don't have time to enjoy the gigantic story.

While the fight to capture the island is not really 'in doubt', the Marines have a difficult time of wresting control of the place from the tough Japanese defenders.  The main battle campaign starts with the Marines aboard their transports.  From there they must move onto the landing craft and make their approaches to the beach.  The fire from the Japanese ashore is heavy and, as the Marines dicovered to their dismay, the reef causes a major disruption in the landing plan.  It also creates plenty of easy targets for the Japanese player to hammer.  Once ashore the Marines are going to be hammering away with everything they have and the dugin enemy positions are hard to eliminate.  Securing the island within 4 days is no picnic and playing it safe will not cut it.  The Marines need to be aggressive and willing to take casualties in order to move forward.\n\nIn the Landing system all Marines start on their transports.  When they become available on the Wave Chart they are loaded onto their landing craft.  From there they move to the Landing Craft Beach Chart.  From here the Landing Craft determine which hexrow of the beach lane they will enter the map.  This can cause some serious traffic jams.  Then the landing craft make their run ins' to the beach.  This is pretty exciting in itself, but then the Marines find wire and mine obstacles waiting for them in front of the sandy beach.  These cause major problems in landing.  The net result of all this is some very high nervousness about whether the Marines will get a solid bridgehead ashore.  The most problematic beach is RED 1.  The Marines here almost didn't make it and it is where the 'the Issue is in Doubt' quote comes from.  You will do better I'm sure.\n\nThere are some small scenarios, focusing on 1 beach, an intro scenario of the 2/8 Marines attacking on 22 Nov, and a 'what if' scenario should the Marine player decide to try his hand landing on the 'Black' beaches.  These beaches were located on the seaward side of the island and were covered by extensive minefields.

The Allies executed a forward concentration behind the cover of their screens.

Bl\u00fccher himself was wounded and separated from headquarters. But Napoleon\u2019s hoped-for knock-out blow remained undelivered.\n\nWavre, Grouchy\u2019s Blunder, 18 June \nNapoleon separated the two wings of his army, ordering Marshal Grouchy on the track of the Prussians while he pursued Wellington.  Grouchy\u2019s prescribed route was wide of the mark, and took him to the outer flank, allowing the Prussians to interpose themselves between the two French wings\u2014Bl\u00fccher achieved a strategic reversal of the opening.\n\nWaterloo, A Near Run Thing, 18 June \nWhile Grouchy frittered away time engaging the Prussian rear-guard at Wavre, Ney conducted the mid-phase of the battle like a rear-guard action in the Peninsular Campaign, failing to provide infantry support for his spectacular cavalry charges. Wellington fought a successful defensive battle, managing to cling to his ridge until the arrival of three Prussian corps. The broken French army retreated toward Charleroi; Grouchy\u2019s intact wing moved south-east toward Namur.\n\nLa Souffel, Rapp\u2019s Last Stand, 28 June\nThree days after Waterloo, Rapp woke up and began a slow withdrawal from the Rhine, pursued by the vanguard of Schwarzenberg's Army. On June 26 the heavily-outnumbered Rapp skirmished with the Austrian III Corps. Two days later he made a stand along the Souffel River, and the Austrians attacked.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nSeries: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: \n\n     480 meters per hex, \n     1 hour per turn, \n     400-800 men per strength point. \n\n\nEach Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns.

As they learn the game's basic maneuver and combat systems, they will then layer on more advanced systems for Strategic bombing, submarine attacks on merchant shipping, search and detection, amphibious assaults, and extensive Operations driven by their command decisions.\n\nPacific War is a source of limitless challenge and excitement for anyone ever fascinated with the fury and vastness of the Pacific War.\n\nPacific War is also a time machine back to the halcyon days of the monster game. However, despite what you may have heard, Pacific War is NOT a monster game, but rather an operational World War II air-land-sea game system that lets you fight EVERY Pacific battle and campaign of significance. The original game came with 21 scenarios. This new edition will add at least half a dozen more. The game gains its monster game reputation from the fact that in order to fight all of these campaigns, you need a large number of counters (over 2000) that represent individual capital ships, cruiser divisions, destroyer squadrons, aircraft groups, and land units ranging from battalions to divisions to corps, with all units individually rated based on their historic performance.\n\n\nThe game map is an equal area map (two mounted maps) which is the grandfather of the Empire of the Sun map. Each hex is 100 miles and covers the entire Pacific from Hawaii to India and Alaska to Australia. The game will also come with a separate map focused on the Solomon Islands where many of the interesting and balanced scenarios occur. What made Victory Games' Pacific War unique in 1985 remains true in GMT\u2019s 2020 edition. The design integrates strategic/operational intelligence into a telescoping time mechanic that allows campaigns to progress in a logical asymmetric flow, accompanied by tense game play. Pacific War is a deep historical simulation, so if this is not what you are looking for in a new purchase, please read no further. So, how is this level of simulation achieved?\n\nDuring each monthly turn you bid command points (logistics) to determine initiative (offensive player), with the high bid then activating and launching their forces toward their objectives. Secretly,  your opponent (reaction player) determines the operational intelligence level and their potential to intercept the offensive. As the offensive develops, it comes within range of enemy air and submarine forces that tactically attempt to detect the oncoming attack. The reaction player decides how to defeat the attack based on the intersection of tactical and operational intelligence coupled with available forces and logistics.\n\nThis entire sequence is set within a telescoping time scale (days to hours) that has naval units seamlessly accelerate (from 12 to 30+ knots), searches seek out the enemy, carriers launch air strikes, combat air patrols defend, culminating with torpedo and dive bomber attacks on individual naval targets. At its core, Pacific War\u2019s game systems allows you to fight detailed carrier strikes (sequential and simultaneous) with night surface naval actions (float planes, gunfire and torpedo salvos) integrated with large scale ground offensives on the Asian mainland (e.g., Malaya, Burma, and China) and of course amphibious invasions (e.g., Java, Guadalcanal, and Leyte). If you are looking for a detailed and interactive operational simulation of the War in the Pacific, this is the game for you!\n\n\nSo, what will change in the new version? The structure and feel of the design will be unchanged, so if you played it in your youth, you already know how to play. That said, a devoted number of players have been playing this game for 35 years and I have incorporated the best of their feedback into this new and final edition for this title. I am going over each scenario and updating them with information that I did not have available back in 1985. For example, I now have several Japanese translations of their official records that were only published in the last few years. Toward this end, I am adding at least six new campaign and strategic scenarios, so you can experience the entire panorama of the war in a long afternoon .\n\n\nThe key question that I consider when buying a new game is will it hit the table? The owners and reviewers who created the game's reputation were excited that Pacific War had a layered set of scenarios that incorporated fifteen-minute solitaire learning engagements, two hour battles (such as Coral Sea and Santa Cruz that were used in a decade of tournaments), two to eight hour Campaigns (such as Malaya, Guadalcanal and Breaking the Bismarck barrier), and of course the Strategic scenarios that cover the entire war from a single year to the entire war. Will you ever play the entire war? It's unlikely (to date I have only done it three times). However, Pacific War is an operational level game and the Campaign scenarios are the heart and soul of this game system. Most play in an afternoon to completion. So, will it hit the table? Only you can answer that question, but from a time and learning perspective this game will support any time commitment you wish to make, to include the 100+ hour Strategic Scenario.\n\n\nThe other question that was not asked back in 1985, but to many is important in 2020 is \"does Pacific War have a solitaire \u2018Bot system?\" The answer is no, with an explanation. The only game decision that cannot reasonably be made is the Operations bidding mechanic and the original game included a solitaire bidding mechanic which will be retained. I will look to see if there are any other similar decisions, such as surface action range bids that I have already added. Thereafter, you will need to play both sides. Due to the history and the game system you will likely not notice as you experience the war\u2019s narrative unfold before you. So, although Pacific War will not have a \u2018Bot (not even sure how to do that with over 25 scenarios), the game will handle all the interactive bids decisions. If you want a full-blown solitaire opponent, this is not the game for you. \n GAME CONTENTS\n4 inch box\n3 rulebooks\n2 22 x 34 inch mounted maps\n1 cardboard scenario map\n9 counter sheets\n1 pad of 24 Replacement Record Sheets\n1 8.5 x 22 Operations Display\n1 11 x 34 Japanese Display Sheet\n1 11 x 34 Allied Display Sheet\n1 11 x 34 Japanese Screen\n1 11 x 34 Allied Screen\nbaggies\n2 ten-sided dice\n -description from publisher's website\n\nGAME CONTENTS AS RECEIVED:\n\n2 Mounted Maps (22\"x 34\" each)\n1 Paper map (17\"x 22\"), subset of mounted maps\n2 sheets of 9/16\" counters, 384 total including 14 blanks - ships\n8 sheets of 1/2\" counters, 2240 total including 12 blanks - everything else\n1 Core Rules Booklet, 68 pages, with index\n1 Engagement Scenario Rules Booklet, 40 pages, subset of Core Rules Booklet with index\n1 Battle Scenario Rules Booklet, 44 pages, subset of Core Rules Booklet with index\n1 Scenario Booklet, with 34 scenarios - 8 engagement, 12 battle, 9 campaign, and 5 strategic scenarios, 72 pages\n1 Battle of the Coral Sea (Extended Example of Play) Booklet, 16 pages\n1 Operation Display (8.5\" x 22\")\n1 Allied Task Force Display (8.5\" x 11\")\n1 Allied Force/Task Force Display (8.5\" x 11\")\n2 Allied Force Displays (8.5\" x 11\" each)\n1 Allied Screen (11\" x 34\")\n1 Allied Player Display (11\" x 34\")\n1 Japanese Force/Task Force Display (8.5\" x 11\")\n2 Japanese Force Displays (8.5\" x 11\" each)\n1 Japanese Task Force Display (8.5\" x 11\")\n1 Japanese Screen (11\" x 34\")\n1 Japanese Player Display (11\" x 34\")\n1 Pad of Replacement Record Sheets\n2 Ten Sided Dice (one orange, one blue)\nNo counter tray, no bags\nall Booklets and Displays in Color\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2022.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 6000.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 6000.0, "minage": 16.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 209, 'average': 8.91881, 'bayesaverage': 5.78729, 'stddev': 1.52032, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1147, 'trading': 16, 'wanting': 27, 'wishing': 148, 'numcomments': 111, 'numweights': 39, 'averageweight': 4.7436, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4139}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 186}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 8, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 8, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 209.0, "average": 8.91881, "bayesaverage": 5.78729, "stddev": 1.52032, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1147.0, "trading": 16.0, "wanting": 27.0, "wishing": 148.0, "numcomments": 111.0, "numweights": 39.0, "averageweight": 4.7436, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4139}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 186}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 301615, "name": "Hood Strikes North: The Tennessee Campaign, Fall 1864", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6E2AIyKxjOSOymvKlQ01dQ__thumb/img/7PQxeCM6-xaNJ0PAh3VBmQJp0SI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6141012.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6E2AIyKxjOSOymvKlQ01dQ__original/img/taK5FYcMox9Yb-zhqxayznhH2zg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6141012.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Nashville (Tennessee, USA)', 'Country: USA', 'Players: Two Player Only Games', 'Players: Wargames with Rules Supporting Only Two Players', 'Series: Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (Avalon Hill/MMP)', 'States: Tennessee']", "categories": "['American Civil War', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['Joseph M.

It depicts the desperate offensive undertaken by General John Bell Hood\u2019s Army of Tennessee in November 1864 through central Tennessee in an effort to capture Union-held Nashville. Union forces defending the critical Nashville-Chattanooga corridor, led by Maj. Gen. George Thomas (\u201cThe Rock of Chickamauga\u201d), were initially scattered and ill-prepared to meet Hood\u2019s thrust. But under Thomas\u2019 prudent and patient leadership, the Rebels were stopped at the gates of Nashville and then thoroughly defeated by a Union offensive in mid-December.\n\nHood Strikes North will include a single map, two countersheets, and limited special rules, thereby making it a highly suitable game for newcomers to the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series. The game is designed by Joe Balkoski (the original GCACW series creator), Chris Withers, and Ed Beach. Based on mid-19th century Tennessee county maps, the game map will adhere to the high graphic standards of its predecessors, with map design executed by artist Charlie Kibler\u2014whose work on the series dates back to its creation in 1992.\n\nHood Strikes North will use the latest version of the GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that all other games in the series use. After more than a quarter of a century of refinement, these rules are extremely well organized and relatively easy to learn, even for series newcomers. The Advanced Game rules will cover situations specifically applicable to the November \u2013 December 1864 timeframe.\n\nHood Strikes North includes eight Basic Game scenarios and one Advanced Game campaign, all extensively playtested:\n\n    Here Come the Rebels! (November 24, 1864, 1 turn): Introductory scenario, great for learning how to play, depicting the arrival of Nathan Bedford *Forrest\u2019s Rebel cavalry in central Tennessee, as Union forces under Maj. Gen. John Schofield hastily retreat to Columbia, Tennessee, covered by their cavalry.\n    The Race for Columbia (November 23 \u2013 29, 1864, 7 turns): The initial attempt by Hood to cut off Union forces in southern Tennessee from Nashville.\n    A Great Chance Was Lost (November 28 \u2013 29, 1864, 2 turns): Hood\u2019s army outflanks Union troops defending Columbia, Tennessee, and at Spring Hill attempts to cut them off from Nashville.\n    We Will Make the Fight (November 30 \u2013 December 1, 1864, 2 turns): Union troops under Maj. Gen. John Schofield make a stand against Hood\u2019s onrushing army at Franklin, Tennessee in their attempt to escape to Nashville.\n    The Battle of Nashville (December 15 \u2013 16, 1864, 2 turns): Thomas takes the offensive and strikes hard at Hood\u2019s Rebel army entrenched on the outskirts of Nashville.\n    The Enemy Was Badly Whipped (December 4 \u2013 7, 1864, 4 turns): While the Rebels entrench south of Nashville, Hood orders Nathan Bedford Forrest to attack the Union stronghold at Murfreesboro in an attempt to relieve pressure on Hood\u2019s eastern flank.\n    Hood\u2019s Retreat (December 17 \u2013 19, 1864, 3 turns): Maj. Gen. James Wilson\u2019s Federal cavalry aggressively pursues Hood\u2019s beaten army, but Forrest\u2019s Rebel cavalry stands in the way.\n    That Devil Forrest (December 23 \u2013 24, 1864, 2 turns): A fast-playing introductory scenario for learning how to play multiple turns. Forrest\u2019s Rebel cavalry is the rear guard trying to delay pursuing Union infantry and cavalry.\n    Hood Strikes North (November 23 \u2013 December 24, 1864, 32 turns): advanced scenario - A depiction of the entire campaign.\n\n\nContents\n\n    GCACW Series rules booklet (24 pages, including illustrations, play examples, charts)\n    Hood Strikes North rules booklet (36 pages, including scenarios, the Game as History, map gazetteer, etc.)\n    one 22\" x 32\" full-color map sheet\n    two countersheets (560 counters)\n    one Terrain Effects Chart\n    two full-color Force Displays\n    two 4-page color Charts and Tables\n    two 6-sided Dice\n\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2020.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1920.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 1920.0, "minage": 16.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 104, 'average': 8.70914, 'bayesaverage': 5.65439, 'stddev': 1.0132, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 569, 'trading': 5, 'wanting': 41, 'wishing': 75, 'numcomments': 45, 'numweights': 7, 'averageweight': 3.5714, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6067}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 530}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 104.0, "average": 8.70914, "bayesaverage": 5.65439, "stddev": 1.0132, "median": 0.0, "owned": 569.0, "trading": 5.0, "wanting": 41.0, "wishing": 75.0, "numcomments": 45.0, "numweights": 7.0, "averageweight": 3.5714, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6067}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 530}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 350329, "name": "La Bataille de Berlin 1813", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/18W7Wxm446FF2vXP2ACMmw__thumb/img/WIGT7Vp5Q8QuW2X6LLBNKt068ik=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6495264.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/18W7Wxm446FF2vXP2ACMmw__original/img/TP3jy0e6OYSGDwFIW7MuNxXPiEo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6495264.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Prussia', 'History: Napoleonic Wars', 'Series: La Bataille (Clash of Arms Games)']", "categories": "['Napoleonic', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['James Soto', 'Dennis A.

From September 1939 until the surrender of Japan, the high seas were a global battle zone filled with mighty battleships, nimble cruisers, silent hunters, and flat-tops bristling with planes. Before our eyes, we witnessed the changing of warfare on the high seas as the thunderous old guard fell to air power and submarine Raiders prowled the open waters and the carrier showed its true diversity and adaptability.\n\nSeas of Thunder not only allows players to re-create the Atlantic or Pacific theaters of the war but to see how challenging the entire picture was for their leaders. How do you protect a globe from German raiders? How desperate was it for Britain when France fell and they were left to fight Germany and Italy alone on the high seas? What is the right balance for the Soviet fleet split between four distinct fronts (Baltic, Black Sea, Arctic, and Pacific)? If the Mediterranean force weakens for the allies, from where do they draw ships? Does Japan strike quickly or play for attrition when they arrive on the halfway point? Will America fight in two fronts, three, or four?\n\nIn Seas of Thunder, players will experience the tension of too much sea to cover with too few ships, the frustration of being caught unprepared, or the intensity of a vital stand contesting a high-value sea area. Victory is neither sudden nor guaranteed. In each battle, a flight of Catalinas, the lack of ASW, the improper distribution of air power, or even a missing minesweeper could be the difference between success or failure.\n\nWhat's in the Box\n\nSeas of Thunder may not have every ship in the conflict, but it has the ones you know.\n\n1 Mounted Map (Double-Sided with pre-Pearl Harbor scoring on one side and post-Pearl Harbor scoring on the other)\n\n1200+ Combat Ship counters (Capital ships down to Destroyer Squadrons, Submarine Grops, and Mine-sweeping Flotillas)\n\n132 Convoy & Utility counters\n\n14 Port Cards (1 per side for each of 7 scenarios)\n\nCombat Sequence Cards for tracking combat\n\nPlus sundry dice, rules, scenario details...the usual.\n\nSeas of Thunder is every bit a full-force strategic-level representation of the conflict on the high seas during World War 2. Players have to manage a global disposition of their warships with frequently too much ocean to cover and not nearly enough ships to cover it.\n\nEach nation has access to the historical ships that sailed in the conflict.

The result is that Nations in Arms is an entirely new, and very playable, Napoleonic epic from designer Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois-Stanislas Thomas.\n\nPlayers control every major and minor power of the Napoleonic period: from the largest participants to the smallest. This allows anywhere from 2 to 7 players to participate in the game. Players are challenged with strategically managing their annual national production, diplomacy, and most importantly, war.\n\nThe game systems emphasize the military importance of lines of communication, the command and control ability of skilled leaders, quality of troops above quantity, and the impact of battle, epic sieges and attrition on a nation. You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.\n\nEach game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns. A Chit Activation system is used to recreate the \u2018chaos of war\u2019, and events occur using an Historical Event card deck. This combination of variable chit pull and card play ensures a high replay value of the ten (10) scenarios. Nations in Arms features a one-turn tutorial scenario , four epic campaign scenarios, and five smaller scenarios.\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn to either fan the flames of The French Revolution throughout Europe, or to preserve the Old Order\u2026\n\nComponents:\n\n    2 map sections making a 56\u201d wide by 39\u201d high playing area\n    4 countersheets\n    6 full color 8.5\" x 11\" cards with various tables, charts  and player aids\n    1 card deck (110 cards) of historical and tactical events\n    1 rules booklet\n    1 scenario booklet\n    2 dice\n    1 box and lid set - the big 3\u201d deep box\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2012.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 7.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 3000.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 98, 'average': 7.22347, 'bayesaverage': 5.58017, 'stddev': 1.62818, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 455, 'trading': 6, 'wanting': 29, 'wishing': 140, 'numcomments': 64, 'numweights': 19, 'averageweight': 4.0526, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8688}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1312}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 9, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 6, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 6, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 6, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 7, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '7': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '7+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}}}", "usersrated": 98.0, "average": 7.22347, "bayesaverage": 5.58017, "stddev": 1.62818, "median": 0.0, "owned": 455.0, "trading": 6.0, "wanting": 29.0, "wishing": 140.0, "numcomments": 64.0, "numweights": 19.0, "averageweight": 4.0526, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8688}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1312}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 347972, "name": "Does It Matter", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Upcoming Releases']", "categories": "['Abstract Strategy', 'Humor', 'Mature / Adult', 'Party Game', 'Science Fiction', 'Trivia']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Acting', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Push Your Luck', 'Race', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Take That']", "designers": "['Annamaria de Govia', 'Raquel King']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Looking for a publisher)']", "description": "Does It Matter? is a dark-humored party game that takes place in the outer reaches of space.

This campaign game lets players recreate, in detail, the fighting of various great battles. Players take up the part of both the overall commanders, choosing which units will reinforce the initial troops, as well as the local commanders, fighting it out for each objective of the campaign. Players use a 'purchase' method to select troops for the first Scenario for the campaign. They set up their troops, determine who will attack and defend in that action then play that Scenario. The end of the Scenario brings the players to the Reorganization Phase, where they resolve the location of the front lines, determine the fate of disorganized and damaged units, and then purchase new units for the next Scenario.\n\nPL 3.0 aims to provide a concise, enjoyable campaign experience, playable by the average gamer over a couple of evenings. Critical Hit regularly releases new CG's for use with Platoon Leader. The latest version of PL is available at Critical Hit as a free download.

Players will fight this might-have-been battle using mostly companies at 500 meters a hex scale. Each turn is 2 hours, and the game uses a \u201cchit-pull\u201d system that makes for both unpredictable face-to-face play as well as an excellent solitaire experience. The maps are painstakingly and meticulously drawn by Antonio Pinar providing perhaps the best major urban map ever made. Greg Sarnecki is also on board to provide the most exacting order of battle also ever made for this campaign. This is the ultimate game of modern urban warfare on a massive scale. As befits a game on modern war, air power, helicopters, electronic warfare, chemical weapons, and sabotage will be included as well. Using all your weapons effectively will determine who wins the battle for Berlin!\n\n\u2013Description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2021.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 1, 'wishing': 20, 'numcomments': 1, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 1.0, "wishing": 20.0, "numcomments": 1.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 10828, "name": "Krieg!

Expectations were high, with four Soviet armies aiming to encircle the German Sixth Army and to recapture the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union. Those expectations were dashed within a fortnight by the German Army\u2019s ability to absorb the offensive and launch a counteroffensive of its own which, in its turn, encircled two Soviet armies.\n\nKharkov, May 1942 \u2013 The Last Disaster is a miniature wargames campaign system, designed for two to four players, covering these events. It is designed for games in which a stand represents a platoon or in which the main unit of manoeuvre is the battalion. Suitable rules would include Spearhead, Blitzkrieg Commander, Command Decision: TOB, A Fistful of Tows, Rapid Fire Reloaded and others, including those which wargamers may have written themselves.\n\nThe system generates fifty or so hours of gaming spread over ten to fifteen individual battles which are fought over six to fifteen daily campaign turns. The number of turns is flexible and determined by whether either player can encircle the enemy\u2019s forces. Progress in the campaign is measured along campaign tracks representing the two major axes of attack with a number of battlefield \u2018spaces\u2019. Each turn players decide whether to attack or not and then which parts of their total forces they commit to any ensuing battle. Battles will generally be around a brigade or regiment of four to eight battalions on each side. The results of each on table battle determine the speed of advance on the main campaign map.\n\nThe book includes\n\n     a brief history of the campaign\n     background information useful in adapting the system to different sets of rules and suggestions for additional optional rules\n     a comprehensive set of Appendices covering\n         the Tables of Organisation and Equipment to platoon level for all divisions and regiments involved (around forty regimental sized formations)\n         a record of the At Start forces and reinforcements\n         a chart to track the position and composition of forces on each attack axis\n         19 colour terrain squares of the battlefields (based on nearly 600 square miles of original 1930s maps) which can be used to generate 570 six feet by four feet tabletops\n         a Campaign Quick Reference Sheet\n         a colour A4 Campaign Map\n         a set of suggestions to convert the system to Bob Cordery\u2019s Portable Wargame rules\n    \n\n\n\n     100 A4 pages with 20+ colour illustrations.\n\n\n\u2013 Description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[{'id': '279418', 'name': 'Blitzkrieg Commander: 4th Edition'}, {'id': '327156', 'name': 'Combat HQ: 2nd Edition'}, {'id': '27480', 'name': 'Command Decision: Test of Battle'}, {'id': '95662', 'name': 'A Fistful of TOWs 3: Miniature Wargame Rules \u2013 Modern Mechanized Warfare 1915-2015'}, {'id': '269556', 'name': 'FiveCore Brigade Commander: Brigade Level Warfare in the 20th Century'}, {'id': '212960', 'name': 'Kampfgruppe Commander III'}, {'id': '289951', 'name': 'The Portable Wargame'}, {'id': '338857', 'name': 'Rapid Fire Reloaded: Fast Play Wargaming Rules for World War Two Land Battles'}, {'id': '10916', 'name': 'Spearhead'}]", "yearpublished": 2021.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 3000.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": "Blitzkrieg Commander (Pendraken Miniatures)", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 8959, "name": "Fire in the East", "alternative_names": "['\u30d0\u30eb\u30d0\u30ed\u30c3\u30b5\u4f5c\u6226']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/60YrvRsC8IcCD2hHibCmgQ__thumb/img/C1q1ad-28jRhsitwd703qQjAThg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic43415.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/60YrvRsC8IcCD2hHibCmgQ__original/img/of5rXQQs9A-PQF5xpz_oakPk13Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic43415.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['History: World War II (Eastern Front)', 'Series: Europa']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "['Total War', 'Drang Nach Osten!']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['John Astell', 'Rich Banner', 'Frank Chadwick']", "artists": "['Rich Banner', 'Rodger B.

It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.\n\nFire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.\nThere are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.\n\nThe rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.\n\nFire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow.

As the Central Powers player YOU control the armies of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and make the difficult strategic decisions the two-front war requires. As the Allied player YOU command the forces of the rest of Europe Including Britain, France, Russia. Italy, Belgium, Rumania, Serbia, and the United States, and carry the burden of forcing back the strongly entrenched enemy corps on both the west and eastern fronts. No other game presents so great a challenge to test each player's grasp of military strategy.\n Ten Historical Scenarios From the summer of 1914 through the final surrender on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day and month of 1918, GUNS OF AUGUST spans the entire First World War in monthly Game-Turns; each player maneuvers hundreds of infantry and cavalry corps and their supporting artillery and engineer regiments. And in addition to this mammoth campaign game, separate scenarios for each front during each year of the war, which can be combined into two-front scenarios for 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917, have been specially designed to allow players to vary the size, difficulty, and playing time of their games.\n\nFor those who think that World War I Is an unexciting subject for a game, GUNS OF AUGUST will prove a shock comparable to the appearance of British tanks at Cambrai, and German stosstrupen at Caporetto.\n\nCOMPLEXITY: Rated \"5\" on a scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (hard) \n1040 Counters\n\n(BGG description :)\n\nAvalon Hill's definitive World War I game.  \nComes with 4 mapboard panels showing all of the major theaters of the war to end all wars.

The air above was suddenly filled with parachutes as thousands of elite German paratroops\u2014Fallschirmj\u00e4ger\u2014descended from the sky.\n\nThe invasion of Crete was one of the most dramatic battles of the Second World War. Over a nine-day period in May 1941, a mixed force of Commonwealth and Greek troops desperately tried to fight off the German assault. Despite appalling casualties, the paratroopers and glider-borne troops managed to secure a foothold and the critical Maleme Airfield to open the door for the German Gebirgsj\u00e4ger (mountain troops) to land under fire. Together the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger and Gebirgsj\u00e4ger pushed the Commonwealth troops to their breaking point and forced a deadly battle of delay and pursuit.\n\nThis was a true soldier\u2019s battle, with both sides in desperate situations often lacking higher-level control and support. The Germans had to quickly secure a usable airfield or face the annihilation of their entire airborne force. The Commonwealth needed to crush the German landings or\u2014failing that\u2014evacuate the bulk of its forces to continue the fight in North Africa and Syria.\n\nThe German invasion of Crete in May 1941 stands as a landmark in the history of airborne warfare. Up until that point, airborne operations were tactical operations to seize key objectives in advance of the ground forces. The German invasion of Crete (codenamed Operation Merkur) was the first strategic airborne operation.\n\nAlthough casualties would mean Crete was the last hurrah for the German airborne in a major air assault, it set the stage for even larger future Allied airborne operations in the Mediterranean, Western Europe, and Asia.\n\nOperation Mercury maintains the same level of detail and scale as other Grand Tactical Series (GTS) games. Players command divisions and maneuver company-sized units to fight one of the most desperate battles of the war. Using the GTS 2.0 rules, Operation Mercury offers two players or teams a wide range of scenarios ranging from a single small map with a few units on each side to the full battle including up to two German divisions and several Commonwealth and Greek brigades. Operation Mercury covers all the major airdrops and fighting across the island from Heraklion in the east, through Rethymnon, and from Maleme to Suda Bay then south to the Askifou Plain, scene of the last major fight during the withdrawal.\n\nAs the Commander of Allied forces on Crete, can you deny the Germans a precious airfield and negate their much-needed air-landing reinforcements for a quick victory? Of all operations of war, a withdrawal under heavy enemy pressure is probably the most difficult and perilous. Can you get the bulk of your forces to the southern evacuation ports? As the German, how quickly can you force the collapse of the Commonwealth morale and trigger their withdrawal?\n\nFeatures include:\n\n\n     Shifting Allied morale state based on relative casualties and key events, which can trigger evacuation and end-game victory conditions.\n     Random events, including tank breakdowns, misdirected airstrikes, and partisan attacks.\n     An option for Commonwealth naval support at the risk of losing precious ships to German air attacks.\n\n\nThirteen scenarios include:\n\n     Separate one-map battles for the airdrops at Rethymnon, Heraklion, and the Maleme/Canea sector.\n     A one-map battle for the New Zealand counter-attack to retake Maleme airfield.\n     One-, two-, and three-map battles for the difficult German advance and Commonwealth delay and withdrawal.\n     The full campaign on all five maps or just the main event from Maleme to Askifou Plain on three maps.\n     Hypothetical German precision drops as well as a German free drop scenario.\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2017.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1710.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 1710.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 123, 'average': 8.0813, 'bayesaverage': 5.63857, 'stddev': 1.50659, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 691, 'trading': 23, 'wanting': 24, 'wishing': 105, 'numcomments': 72, 'numweights': 8, 'averageweight': 3.875, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6470}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 695}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 2, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 123.0, "average": 8.0813, "bayesaverage": 5.63857, "stddev": 1.50659, "median": 0.0, "owned": 691.0, "trading": 23.0, "wanting": 24.0, "wishing": 105.0, "numcomments": 72.0, "numweights": 8.0, "averageweight": 3.875, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6470}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 695}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 2441, "name": "World War II: European Theater of Operations", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cq_Sknj0rarntiZS4bMgzg__thumb/img/zGR39uH2yTJK0_El-BlrjhWNxyM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic277947.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cq_Sknj0rarntiZS4bMgzg__original/img/mqp1bKT-5fwD2nHkFIdNgfXtRnE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic277947.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Components: Map (Global Scale)', 'Continents: Europe']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "['Advanced European Theater of Operations']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Douglas Niles']", "artists": "['Jeff Easley']", "publishers": "['SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)', 'TSR']", "description": "The WORLD WAR grand strategic game covers the European Theater of Operations and the Middle East from 1939 to 1945, with special scenarios for the blitzkrieg in Poland, France, and Russia.

If you own the original 1995 edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, or if you have the upgrade kit, you can continue playing those versions with no problems; those versions still stand the test of time quite well. In this Special 2004 Edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, we've done our best to improve and enhance the components and rules to this already classic game.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n\n    The six countersheets contain all of the original and replacement counters from the first two versions of the game, as well as some new counters and units with modified unit strengths and morale levels based on recent research. Rodger MacGowan and Mark Simonitch have revised and upgraded the original counter graphics, and these counters are printed on the higher-quality stock you've come to expect from us in recent years.\n\n\n\n    Mark Simonitch has completely reworked the three game maps. He's used the original work and maps from Rick Barber and Joe Youst's first two versions as a base, and come up with another of his clean and elegant looks that makes these maps both nice to look at and easy to play on.\n\n\n\n    The GBACW 4.4 rules that appeared in Gringo! were a major step up for the series in terms of both rules streamlining and presentation. We have further edited those rules and released version 4.5 for this new edition of Three Days of Gettysburg.\n\n\n\n    Mark has streamlined and done new layouts on the game charts to give players the best mix yet of readability and utility in the least possible table space. We've also included some neat charts created by Mike Lemick that allow you to easily keep track of the status of each side's command and routed unit status..\n\n\n\n    As you'll note from the graphic above, Rodger has created a whole new game box for this new edition of the game. We think it's some of his best work ever, and hope you agree. The game box is the crowning piece of what is, for a Reprint Edition, about as close to a brand new game, component-wise, as we could get (which is why there is no Update Kit for this version - it would essentially be a whole new game). \n\n\nSo, if your original copy is showing some wear and tear, or if you want an edition of this classic game in which the updated graphics and systems outshine the original (and that is saying a lot), or you simply missed purchasing the first edition of this best-selling game, then this Special 2004 Edition is for you! Enjoy!\n\nGame Features\n\n     A revised Command System, using Maximum Effectiveness to portray the strengths and vicissitudes of battlefield command.\n     Seven scenarios, from microcosm 1-mappers to the full 3-day battle.\n     Brigadiers rated with Action Profiles so that, when on their own, you may never know exactly what they'll do! Will an aggressive Dick Garnett recklessly charge everyone in sight, seeking to regain lost honor? Will a cautious Stannard sit and watch? Or will an unreliable Iverson hit the bottle instead of the front line?\n     Artillery Barrage, simplified Ammo rules, special rules for green units, and an optional Fatigue Rule that really places an emphasis on careful unit usage.\n     A remarkably simple Shock Table that features Continuous Attack: you can roll up the enemy's flank in one massive charge. \n\n\n\n\nComponents:\n\n    six full-color countersheets.\n    Three 22x34\" full-color mapsheets\n    One 11\" X 17\" Player Aid Card\n    System Rulesbook\n    Scenario Booklet\n    4 Setup cards\n    One 10-sided die\n\n\n\n\nDesigner: Richard H. Berg\nDeveloper: John Alsen\n\n\n(user's description:)\n\nThe third edition, otherwise known as the \"2004 edition\" of this very popular tactical level simulation of the battle of Gettysburg.  The game spawned the \"Great Battles of the American Civil War\" series and is a direct descendant of the old SPI favorite, Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game.\n\nComponents include three newly revised and beautiful maps by Mark Simonitch and Joe Youst (building on older work by Rick Barber and Joe Youst), 1680 counters including units and markers, some new charts, and ver. 4.5 of the GBACW rules.\n\nThis edition attempts to bring a simplification to the complicated LOS procedures of the previous editions.  The counters have also been cleaned up and overall this edition has quite a bit of visual appeal.  This game is very complex but is a great simulation of ACW tactics.  However, the game also works with a slimmed down version of the GBACW system rules called \"Simple Great Battles of the ACW,\" the release of which coincided with the publishing of the game.  SGBACW brings the series to players who are do not have the inclination or time to master the relatively formidable GBACW ruleset.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2004.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 4500.0, "minplaytime": 180.0, "maxplaytime": 4500.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 206, 'average': 7.64539, 'bayesaverage': 5.68817, 'stddev': 1.39473, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 682, 'trading': 6, 'wanting': 73, 'wishing': 185, 'numcomments': 103, 'numweights': 48, 'averageweight': 4.2708, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 5421}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 556}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 7, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '6': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '6+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 206.0, "average": 7.64539, "bayesaverage": 5.68817, "stddev": 1.39473, "median": 0.0, "owned": 682.0, "trading": 6.0, "wanting": 73.0, "wishing": 185.0, "numcomments": 103.0, "numweights": 48.0, "averageweight": 4.2708, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 5421}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 556}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 262541, "name": "Don't Get Got!", "alternative_names": "['Lass Dich Nicht Erwischen']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/03kajQYeuaJQP8VydWnOng__thumb/img/if3OIO_W-uNkulzfjzoyp_09KK0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4346773.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/03kajQYeuaJQP8VydWnOng__original/img/IM710JXByN4Al4tLrD-m3mHTmLA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4346773.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Bluffing', 'Humor', 'Party Game']", "implementations": "[\"Don't Get Got!:  Working From Home Edition\", \"Don't Get Got!: A Christmas Party Game\"]", "mechanics": "['Acting']", "designers": "['Zoe Lee', 'James A.

You will not find another such sharp turn in history especially if you remember that it involves a nation of 150 million people...' \n             Leon Trotsky, History of the Russian Revolutions\n\nThe Russian Revolutions: 1914-21 is a social-political conflict game for 2 to 5 players. In the game, players take on the role of one of five factions (Monarchists, Octobrists, Cadets (Constitutional Democrats), Left Reformists, or the Revolutionary Left) active in the events of the Russian Revolutions of 1917. Some factions begin the game as Governing factions with state power; others as the opposition. Whatever your factions, you will need to build your political influence, maintain your military power, manage alliances with other factions, and protect Russia from foreign invaders. The winner of the game is the faction that gains state power, and uses that effectively to change Russian society as its ideology dictates.\n\nThe game is played on two boards, one depicting the European part of Russia, the other representing St. Petersburg/ Petrograd (Russia's capital city and the 'cradle of the revolution'). Political influence is represented by coloured blocks; a vast range of historical leaders as well as military units (with historical designations) are represented by colourful double-sided chits.\n\nThe game uses an innovative system in which player either spend 'action points' to take actions or to buy cards, and thereby gain influence among various significant institutions, organisations, and social groups which can be used in later turns. Historical events are affect play as they are drawn from time-tiered event decks. New cards are added to these decks as certain conditions are met in game play.\n\nUnlike most political games, the Russian Revolutions: 1914-21 is  very suitable for solitaire play. There is little hidden information and, while alliances between factions is an important part of play, these alliances are formed and broken automatically as the ideological position of you faction changes through the game. That means there is no need for long breaks in play where players 'negotiate' and scheme - all your scheming will happen on the board.         \n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2021.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 2400.0, "minplaytime": 360.0, "maxplaytime": 2400.0, "minage": 16.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 2, 'average': 8.5, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.5, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 3, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 13, 'numcomments': 1, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 2.0, "average": 8.5, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.5, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 13.0, "numcomments": 1.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '5497', 'name': 'strategygames', 'friendlyname': 'Strategy Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 197317, "name": "1916: Romania \u2013 Prelude to Blitzkrieg", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qjk3e3FAHEpDmO2p_JnldQ__thumb/img/3NgI8SFJ3ixnyNzEIglqoLmO4Ug=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5013580.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qjk3e3FAHEpDmO2p_JnldQ__original/img/92UhnPYH6jkakJx28SOyZeWCdqw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5013580.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Unreleased Games', 'Country: Romania']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War I']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "['Paul Hederer']", "artists": "['Paul Hederer']", "publishers": "['(Looking for a publisher)']", "description": "1916: Romania \u2013 Prelude to Blitzkrieg is a comprehensively researched operational-level game that explores the intriguing campaign fought in and around Romania from August to December 1916.

The game was created around the mid 16th century (presumably by priests) and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the rediscovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant (if not board game) ever. It has not been shown that Taikyoku Shogi was ever widely played. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves.\" - Wikipedia\n\nTwo players, Black and White, play on a board ruled into a grid of 36 ranks (rows) by 36 files (columns) with a total of 1,296 squares. The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. Each player has a set of 402 wedge-shaped pieces of 209 different types. All pieces are the same color. The orientation of the piece tells which side it is on. The pieces are wedge-shaped with the name of the piece written in kanji on it's face in black. If the piece can promote, then the name of the piece's promoted form is written on the back face, usually in red. Pieces are turned over when promoted.\n\nAn opposing piece is captured by displacement: That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece. Unlike standard Shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured.\n\nLike other large board Shogi variants, this game uses the promotion-by-capture rule. When a piece first makes a capture, it promotes if it can (this is compulsory, not optional). few important pieces do not promote. Promotion has the effect of changing how a piece moves.\n\nThe players alternate making a move, with Black moving first. A move consists of moving a single piece on the board and potentially displacing (capturing) an opposing piece, promoting that piece if it is able to promote.\n\nThe object of the game is to capture the opponent\u2019s King and Crown Princes, of which players start with one of each. Both pieces must be captured to win. Also present is a piece called the Drunken Elephant, which if promoted becomes another Crown Prince which would also need to be captured to win.\n\nA player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games.)\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1600.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1950.0, "minplaytime": 1950.0, "maxplaytime": 1950.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 7, 'average': 7.14286, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 2.29463, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 4, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 6, 'wishing': 15, 'numcomments': 10, 'numweights': 4, 'averageweight': 4.25, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 3, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '2': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}}}", "usersrated": 7.0, "average": 7.14286, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 2.29463, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 6.0, "wishing": 15.0, "numcomments": 10.0, "numweights": 4.0, "averageweight": 4.25, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4666', 'name': 'abstracts', 'friendlyname': 'Abstract Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 118577, "name": "Marketeer", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Betting and Bluffing', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Cooperative Game', 'Open Drafting', 'Trading']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Self-Published)']", "description": "A \"persistent world\" multiplayer boardgame designed to be run continuously for at least 48 hours, preferably more.\n\nMarketeer is a card-based sci-fi exploration, trading and combat game in a persistent board game universe.

How to collect and transform cards is one of the main mechanics of the game, the second is the card-vs-card combat system and the last the financial betting system.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2009.0, "minplayers": 8.0, "maxplayers": 120.0, "playingtime": 4500.0, "minplaytime": 4500.0, "maxplaytime": 4500.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '7': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '8': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '9': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '10': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '11': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '12': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '13': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '14': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '15': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '16': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '17': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '18': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '19': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '20': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '21': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '22': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '23': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '24': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '25': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '26': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '27': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '28': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '29': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '30': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '30+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "30+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 256237, "name": "Weltindor's Stones", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Upcoming Releases', 'Crowdfunding: Kickstarter']", "categories": "['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Action Points', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Tile Placement', 'Worker Placement']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Self-Published)']", "description": "Weltindor's Stones is a fairly simple game to win, despite it actually being lightly complex. The board is set up with nine platforms, each of which is split into a 3 by 3 grid. The platforms are all set out about 3 inches from each other, and connected by bridges, which are 1 tile long and create choke points. The corners are elevated about 1 inch off the ground, which gives an advantage to the player on them by giving them a higher chance to attack successfully. Each player is given a corner and the board to the left of the corner. The corner itself is named the lead board. On each of that player's platforms, there will be one stone, which can be moved by other players by having three individual units on the same tile as that stone. The overall point is to get 5 stones to your lead board.\n\nA single turn consists of placing five units and moving them as a group or single unit 5 times. A move can also be spent attacking an adjacent square. Different units have different abilities, such as being able to attack from 2 tiles, or moving 2 tiles at once.\n\n5 basic soldiers can come together to form a barracks, which essentially acts as a factory allowing extra units to be placed at the beginning of your turn. Barracks have to be hit 5 times to be destroyed. The leftover neutral platform in the middle acts as free land to establish barracks for anyone who can get there.\n\nAction cards are abilities that cost mana (You get 1 mana at the beginning of your turn.), and can be played whenever they are needed, not specifically on your turn.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2018.0, "minplayers": 4.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 40320.0, "minplaytime": 45.0, "maxplaytime": 40320.0, "minage": 7.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 1, 'numcomments': 1, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 1.0, "numcomments": 1.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 283736, "name": "Sleeping Gods: Tides of Ruin", "alternative_names": "['Sleeping Gods: Ruines Ancestrales', 'Szunnyad\u00f3 istenek: A roml\u00e1s hull\u00e1mai', 'U\u015bpieni bogowie: Fala zag\u0142ady', '\u0421\u043f\u043b\u044f\u0447\u0456 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u0438: \u0425\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0456 \u0417\u043d\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f', '\u0421\u043f\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u0438: \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0432 \u0440\u0443\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0445', '\uc2ac\ub9ac\ud551 \uac13\uc988: \ud3d0\ud5c8\uc758 \ubb3c\uacb0']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l0BQVDtQ5St4IK2nOO8-gA__thumb/img/K18q5waDJlIXU_Jrrzuh9w2O_qc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5908969.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l0BQVDtQ5St4IK2nOO8-gA__original/img/N9lvu7iz02rzv_O9Z1mMqLAXeP4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5908969.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": "['Crowdfunding: Kickstarter', 'Crowdfunding: Wspieram', 'Game: Sleeping Gods']", "categories": "['Adventure', 'Expansion for Base-game', 'Exploration', 'Nautical']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck', 'Storytelling']", "designers": "['Ira Fay', 'Ryan Laukat']", "artists": "['Ryan Laukat']", "publishers": "['Red Raven Games', 'dV Giochi', 'Games7Days', 'Keep Exploring Games', 'Lavka Games', 'Lotus Frog Games', 'Lucky Duck Games', 'Reflexshop']", "description": "The Wandering Sea is vast, filled with hidden treasures and lost totems.

This city has always been a battleground for strategists. In the past two thousand years, 158 bloody battles have been recorded in history.\n\nIn November 1948, a decisive battle of unprecedented scale was about to break out. The number of troops participating in the war exceeded that at any time in the past. The total number of troops invested by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached 1.4 million. Compared with other wars in history, it is really not worth it.\n\nWith regard to this decisive battle, the strategic objectives of the two sides are different, and they also have two different names. The Kuomintang's expectation of the campaign was that the whole army would guarantee the lifeline of the railway from Xuzhou to Bengbu on the Jinpu line, so it was named \"Xubeng battle\". Su Yu's plan is to attack Haizhou first and then win the two criteria. Therefore, our side is called \"Huaihai Campaign\".\n\nIn this decisive battle to determine the fate of a country and a nation, the Kuomintang army invested more than 800000 people and the people's Liberation Army invested 600000 people. In the end, 600 thousand destroyed the 800 thousand. Over the years, the war history textbooks of military academies in various countries have called this campaign a \"classic war example\" and studied it as a major topic.

World War 2 in Europe (USE) is a strategic level game covering the World War II European Theater. Players make the political decisions and control the military forces of the three major factions that struggled for European dominance and survival.\n\nWith its emphasis on force projection and decision making, players remain focused on the big picture of managing their front lines and political opportunities. Through simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the strategic action without a myriad of complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.\n\nAs one gamer put it, \"It is a delight to be spending my limited brain power on making (or agonizing over) operational decisions that are as dependent upon guts as they are gray matter. This game is not a series of arithmetic exercises, and the only variable in these algorithms is nerve.\"\n\nThough the focus is on the big picture, Unconditional Surrender! still delivers historical detail. Each country has an historical army level order of battle, and its relative economic strength and national will to fight are effectively and simply modeled. Also represented are such World War II events as airdrops, Free Forces, jets, naval evacuation, partisans, radar, railroad artillery guns, and ULTRA; all neatly woven into the game's core mechanics for ease of play\n\nThe game has many scenarios ranging from quick playing individual campaigns to longer ones covering up to the entire war.\n\nDesign Highlights\n\n     Scale: army, fleet, or air wing level units; 30-60 miles per hex; monthly turns \n     Players: 2-4\n     Playing Time: 30 minutes to 50 hours, depending on the scenario\n     Low On-Map Counter Density: The number of counters on the map is relatively low.\n     Simple Stacking: No more than one air, ground, convoy, or warship unit per hex.\n     No Factors on Counters: There are no combat or movement factors on counters.\n     Single Combat System: One combat resolution sequence and Combat Results Table covers all types of combat, yet the results differ for air/naval, ground, or strategic combat. \n     Integrated Movement/Combat System: Units move and fight in a combined activation. \n     \"Use it or Lose it\" Economic System: Simple math with minimal record keeping\n     Historical or Variable Entry: Units and events can enter play using an historical or variable time line. \n     Variable Politics: Most countries\u2019 belligerence and faction alliance is not predetermined.\n     Solitaire Friendly: Though not designed with solitaire rules, the mechanics easily allow one player to play the game.\n     PBEM Capable: The game can be played using PBEM software, but its mechanics require frequent exchanges.\n\n\n\n\nTIME SCALE:    Monthly Turns\nMAP SCALE:     30 to 40 miles per hex\nUNIT SCALE:     Army, Fleet or Wing\n\nDESIGNER: Salvatore Vasta\nDEVELOPER: Mark Dey\nMAP ART: Salvatore Vasta & Mark Simonitch\nCOUNTER ART: Charlie Kibler\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2014.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 3.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 942, 'average': 8.15325, 'bayesaverage': 6.3203, 'stddev': 1.56876, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 2584, 'trading': 54, 'wanting': 152, 'wishing': 823, 'numcomments': 390, 'numweights': 104, 'averageweight': 3.7308, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 1503}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 32}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 41, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 29, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '2': {'best_rating': 27, 'recommended_rating': 8, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 9, 'recommended_rating': 15, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '3+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 6, 'not_recommended_rating': 21}}}", "usersrated": 942.0, "average": 8.15325, "bayesaverage": 6.3203, "stddev": 1.56876, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2584.0, "trading": 54.0, "wanting": 152.0, "wishing": 823.0, "numcomments": 390.0, "numweights": 104.0, "averageweight": 3.7308, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 1503}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 32}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 288535, "name": "The Jaws of Victory: Battle of Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket \u2013 January/February 1944", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0_4HaT2y0bGSjt7DSTmnzw__thumb/img/z0v0f-a1PMPUmI4T0aQIjtMZRQw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5227968.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0_4HaT2y0bGSjt7DSTmnzw__original/img/NI1n2Y01zsDb53xKAVlHyrYnvKk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5227968.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Korsun (Ukraine)', 'Country: Germany', 'Country: Russia', 'Country: Soviet Union', 'Country: Ukraine', 'History: World War II (Eastern Front)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Ratio / Combat Results Table', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation', 'Variable Set-up', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Milt Janosky']", "artists": "['Mark Hinkle']", "publishers": "['New England Simulations']", "description": "The Jaws of Victory: Battle of Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket: January/February 1944 is a historical simulation of the Soviet's winter offensive in the Ukraine in the early months of 1944 that trapped the better part of two German corps with a classic pincer movement by two Soviet Armies - and the German Army's desperate response to relieve their beleaguered comrades in the pocket.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the German Kursk Offensive in July of 1943, the Soviets unleashed a series of major offensives to clear the Ukraine of the German Army.  By mid-January of 1944, the Red Army had liberated the area north and east of the Dnepr and seized Kiev. Further south, they crossed the Dnepr bend, capturing Kirovograd and continued deep into the western Ukraine.  The Germans, however, maintained a hold on the Dnepr near Korsun in an exposed salient 70 miles southwest of Kiev.  Hitler insisted on holding the salient and refused requests from his generals to withdraw to more defensible positions.  This exposed salient was too tempting a target for the Soviets and in January, 1944 Stavka ordered the 1st & 2nd Ukrainian Fronts to conduct a major operation; striking against the base of the salient to surround and eliminate two German Corps within.  The 2nd Ukrainian Front would breakthrough in the east on the 25th and race westward while the 1st Ukrainian Front would attack toward the east a day later; sealing the pocket at Zvenigorodka.  The Soviet offensive was a stunning success, slamming the gate on 60,000 men from six German divisions, including the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking.  But, the Germans were not about to let the Korsun pocket become another \"Stalingrad\".  Within a week they struck back with eight panzer divisions in a two-pronged counter-stroke of their own; this time to deal the Red Army an unexpected defeat from the Jaws of Victory.\n\nSeven separate scenarios covering the period from January 26 to February 18, including a 25-turn campaign game, allow both sides plenty of opportunities for offensive and defensive action.\n\nAs the Soviet player, you begin with a two-pronged offensive, striking hard at the base of the German salient in an attempt to trap as many German units as possible.  If you succeed, you must then turn your attention southward to build the \"outer ring\" in preparation for the German counter-offensive, while systematically chewing away at the supply-starved defenders in the pocket.\n\nAs the German player, you must slow the Soviet drives from both east and west by fighting a two-front defense, and if possible bring them to a halt.  Once the pocket forms, you must skillfully hang on and preserve as many of the trapped units as possible, and wait for you Panzer Divisions from the south to carve open an escape route.\n\nAnd both sides will have to contend with overstretched supply line, bad weather, and tank-stopping mud.\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 day\nHex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers\nUnits: Battalion to Divisions\n\nGame Inventory:\n\n    Two 22 x 34\" full color mapsheets\n    Five dual-side printed countersheet (1,170 1/2\" counters - 4 full size & 1 half countersheets)\n    One 32-page Jaws of Victory Rule Book\n    One 28-page Jaws of Victory Play Book\n    One single-side printed Game-Turn Record Track\n    One dual-side printed Sequence of Play Chart\n    One single-side printed Combat Phase Sequence Player Aide Card\n    One single-side printed German Player Aide Card\n    One single-side printed Soviet Player Aide Card\n    One single-side printed Terrain Effects Chart\n    One single-side printed Combat Results Table\n    Eight Dual-Side printed Scenario Cards (4 German & 4 Soviet)\n    One dual-side printed Combat Manuals/Credits/Historical wrapper\n    One single-side printed Game Errata card\n    Two 6-sided dice\n\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Moderate-High\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 6-50 hours\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2020.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 360.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 16.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 99, 'average': 8.67576, 'bayesaverage': 5.64639, 'stddev': 1.34503, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 414, 'trading': 5, 'wanting': 28, 'wishing': 85, 'numcomments': 55, 'numweights': 13, 'averageweight': 4.1538, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6267}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 566}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5+': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 99.0, "average": 8.67576, "bayesaverage": 5.64639, "stddev": 1.34503, "median": 0.0, "owned": 414.0, "trading": 5.0, "wanting": 28.0, "wishing": 85.0, "numcomments": 55.0, "numweights": 13.0, "averageweight": 4.1538, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6267}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 566}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 288566, "name": "The Third Winter: The Battle for the Ukraine September 1943-April 1944", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kEPpqAJSfsF-Qjes-YzETA__thumb/img/76bAsDLnE8reLJTGkX9xK1srGpo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5303662.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kEPpqAJSfsF-Qjes-YzETA__original/img/YGZkszwd_FCfSUy611rV9D2C4TU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5303662.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Germany', 'Country: Soviet Union', 'Country: Ukraine', 'History: World War II (Eastern Front)', 'Series: Operational Combat Series (MMP)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[\"Hube's Pocket\"]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Antony Birkett', 'Dean Essig', 'Chip Saltsman']", "artists": "['Curtis Baer', 'Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi', 'Dean Essig']", "publishers": "['Multi-Man Publishing']", "description": "The Third Winter: The Campaign for the Ukraine, September 1943 - April 1944, begins with the \u201cRace to the Dnepr,\u201d as Army Group South rushed to a secure defensive position behind one of Europe\u2019s largest rivers.   Four powerful Soviet Fronts must be used in close cooperation to overcome the Axis forces, which include two Panzer Armies. The game contains 85% of the total Wehrmacht\u2019s mechanized strength at this stage of the war and 75% of the Red Army\u2019s.   The Germans must hold the Dnepr barrier as long as possible, followed by a fighting retreat to the Carpathian Mountains to the west.  The Soviets can crush the Axis invader with the advantage of their most reliable ally:  General Winter.  It is the Third Winter on the Russian Front.\n\nThe Soviets have the initiative and a formidable force, but an equally challenging task.  The Dnepr is a huge obstacle and the German panzer formations are wounded but dangerous.  The German player has the challenge of active defense in the style of Army Group South Commander Erich von Manstein.  Both sides are in for a challenging fight.\n\nThe Third Winter is a big game, with 5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. The battles from this campaign \u2013 the Race to the Dnepr, the Battle of Kiev, Korsun Pocket, the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket (\u201cHube\u2019s Pocket\u201d) and the splitting of Army Group South in two\u2014merge into the dynamic of whole campaign.  \nSpecial rules in this 19th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this intense campaign. They include:\n\n\u2022 Soviet Front command structure is modeled by the four Fronts being either on Offensive or Paused posture.  The Soviet player can switch one front \u201coff\u201d and another \u201con\u201d to shift focus and force the Axis to deal with sudden threats in a different part of the map.  When Soviet formations are burned out, they withdraw into the \u201cRVGK\u201d for rebuilding, and can reappear suddenly in a new area, enabling Maskirovka surprises.  Each Front has a dedicated Air Army and Frontal Barrages to initiate offensives. The game shows the increasing strength and competency of the Red Army in both units and Action ratings.\n\u2022 German units in play include Kampfgruppe Divisions, German Remnants, German Army and Army Group HQs,Tiger Companies, Hartman and JG52 aces, Hans-Ulrich Rudel and his tank-busting aircraft, and the Romanian Home army\n\u2022 Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning Beyond the Rhine. These cover things like Soviet Patrol Boat Raids, Lend-Lease, Fuel Shortages, Heroes who affect combat, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, and Partisan Offensives.

Many \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d could have dramatically changed the world. What if China had surrendered in 1937 and over a million Japanese soldiers would be free to overrun India. There would be no Flying Tigers or Doolittle's Raid, or even Pearl Harbor. If Japan could have mobilized Chinese manpower, the world as we know it might not exist.\n\nWar of the Suns (WotS) was first designed by Leonard To, a Hong Kong native, more than 20 years ago. It won the championship of the First Wargame Design Competition in Hong Kong in 1984. The game has since been updated in the early 90's, and extensively again during the last 3 years. Offering exclusive research based on recently opened Chinese archives, as well as many Japanese and English sources, has made War of the Suns one of the most painstakingly researched and accurate games of its type ever made.\n\nThe title of the \u2014 \"War of the Suns\", refers to the flags of Kuomintang China and Imperial Japan. The game itself covers the period from July 1937 to August 1945. The roughly 1:3,000,000 map covers most of China proper, Burma, Assam area of India, and parts of Thailand and Indochina.\n\nThere is a campaign game as well as 5 separate scenarios, and the game can be played as a 1-4 players' game-with players taking the roles of Japanese, KMT, CCP, and British Commonwealth. In the game, politics will play as vital a role in how the game progresses as the units presented on the map.\n\nOther key game concepts include: \n\n    The HQ activation system - Players move units under the activated HQ. The number of activated HQs is affected by command points, the quality of HQ selected, and whether China is cut off from foreign routes. Randomness and quality of the HQ affects who moves what first.\n    The KMT replacement system - KMT units are divided into 3 levels: The elite units with imported weapons; the standard units equipped with what Chinese herself produced; and the local units which simply bought whatever they could find locally.\n    The Political Affiliation system - Each warlord and minor country has its own home territory. They may be affiliated with different players at different levels under different conditions. Friend may become foe with a random or historical triggering event.\n    The Guerilla System - From the setting up of guerrilla bases to a unique combat system, Guerrilla actions from CCP, KMT, and even British player can be as active as the front line.\n    Optional Rules - The game does not shy away from controversial subjects such as wartime atrocity, opium production, and Japanese collaborators.

All morning long, the men in gray have pressured the Union cavalry. Help finally arrives in the form of I Corps commander Major Gen. John Reynolds. He rides up to the Lutheran Seminary, where Buford is directing the battle from its cupola. Reynolds calls to Buford, \"What goes, John?\" The cavalryman simply points to the long lines of advancing Confederates and says, \"The Devil's to pay!\" Reynolds then asks, \"Can you hold?\", to which Buford responds, \"I reckon I can.\" Reynolds ends the exchange with, \u201cLet\u2019s ride out and see all about it.\" And with that rather brief, mundane conversation began one of the most important and iconic military engagements in history \u2013 the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nA Most Fearful Sacrifice is an epic two-player wargame with over 15 square feet of playing area and 526 playing pieces depicting the fighting that occurred during all three days of this decisive clash. The game utilizes a new ACW operating system called the Black Swan system, which is closely related to the popular Blind Swords game system first introduced in the game The Devil\u2019s To Pay! by Tiny Battle Publishing. This version of the system is specifically designed to handle larger-scale battles yet keep rules overhead low. Players can simulate huge encounters in a reasonable amount of playing time. This is accomplished in one way through the use of card draws rather than chit pulls. Also, players will trigger activations by Corps instead of by lower-level formations but they still have tactical decision-making choices by needing to determine which Divisions get activation priority. Though at a grander scale, this system maintains a tactical feel about it and still emphasizes the three \u201cFOW\u2019s\u201d of war \u2026 the Fortunes of War, the Friction of War and the Fog of War. Players will be challenged to deal with a constantly developing battle situation, never quite sure of what the Gods of War will throw at them, and thus they must always be prepared to deal with historically realistic \u201cblack swan\u201d events.\n\nCOMPONENTS: \n1 \u2013 Full color rulebook\n1 \u2013 Full color scenario Book with THIRTEEN scenarios.

The War (\"TW\") is a hex-and-counter strategic-level game which aims to provide the challenge of a monster game with the ease of play of a moderate complexity war game. Experienced players should be able to play a campaign game in a weekend.\n\nThe game includes several scenarios designed to be fun, challenging mini-games in their own right, each playable in an afternoon. An array of variants and optional rules offers enough scope to make TW most replayable.\n\n\n\n(from Compass Games website)The War: Europe 1939-1945 (TW) is Compass Games\u2019 new WWII strategic level game combining all the best features of the genre into an intuitive, challenging new game. While offering all the expansive features of the WWII Monster Game genre (such as U-Boat warfare, diplomacy, espionage, strategic bombing, jets, rockets and numerous variants for each Major Power), TW also offers tremendous scope in its 12 scenarios (see below).\n\nAlthough not a card driven game (and thus a good candidate for solitaire play), TW includes card play for the U-Boat War, Strategic Bombing, Espionage and Counter Espionage and naval warfare. The cards add elements of bluff and surprise more traditional hex-and-combat-table games cannot. But they\u2019re optional, so TW can be played solitaire in a way CDG\u2019s and block games cannot. Between two (or more) skilled players, no two games are ever likely to be the same. For multiplayer games, up to five gamers can play Campaign Games as Italy, Germany, France, the U.S., Britain and USSR.\n\nFor the hard-core military and naval history buff, TW addresses the details of WWII strategy: what if the Germans really built the carrier Graf Zeppelin; what if Mussolini had upgraded the quality of Italian forces; what if Stalin hadn\u2019t shot many of his best generals during the purges; what if the U.S. had entered the war earlier\u2026or later; what if the British had been able to mobilize the Empire and the Dominions more effectively; what if the U.S. had developed the atomic bomb early enough to use in Europe, and so on.\n\nAlthough the game is the result of extensive research by its designer, TW isn\u2019t a simulation and isn\u2019t intended to be. It\u2019s a \"gamer\u2019s game\" with quick, user-friendly combat systems on land, in the air and at sea. Veteran gamers familiar with classic WWII strategic level games should pick up the game very quickly. For new recruits, the short scenarios teach the basics, but can be played as stand-alone games in their own right. Both realistic and playable, TW should present a rewarding challenge for any WWII strategy game buff.\n\nScenario List for The War: Europe 1939-1945:\n\n    1939 Full War Campaign\n    1941 Campaign\n    1942-43 Turning Point Campaign\n    Poland 1939\n    Norway 1940\n    France 1940\n    Barbarossa 1941\n    North Africa 1941-43\n    The Atlantic Lifeline 1939-45\n    Bolshevik Hordes 1944-45\n    Regia Marina\n    D-Day to VE Day 1944-45\n\n\nComplexity: High (about 8 out of 10)\nPlaying Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)\nSolitaire Suitability: Good\n\nDesigner: Ernie Copley\nDeveloper: Paul Shackleton\nArtist: Mark Mahaffey\n\nComponents:\n\n    2 maps\n    9 full sheets of 5/8\u201d counters\n    Approximately 20 full color 8.5\" x 11\" cards with various displays, tracks, reminders, tables, charts, worksheets, etc.\n    1 rules booklet\n    1 scenario booklet\n    1 deck of variant cards\n    2 dice\n    1 full color box and lid \u2013 the big 3\u201d deep box\n\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '203891', 'name': 'The War: Europe 1939-1945 \u2013 Expansion Kit'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2012.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 1080.0, "minplaytime": 1080.0, "maxplaytime": 1080.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 72, 'average': 7.25833, 'bayesaverage': 5.54596, 'stddev': 2.27607, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 340, 'trading': 15, 'wanting': 26, 'wishing': 106, 'numcomments': 51, 'numweights': 16, 'averageweight': 4.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 11241}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2128}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 2, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 72.0, "average": 7.25833, "bayesaverage": 5.54596, "stddev": 2.27607, "median": 0.0, "owned": 340.0, "trading": 15.0, "wanting": 26.0, "wishing": 106.0, "numcomments": 51.0, "numweights": 16.0, "averageweight": 4.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 11241}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2128}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 220317, "name": "Saipan: The Bloody Rock", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vY1uRFe9AsokBnfOcljWLQ__thumb/img/dZn6KpdM60rd0rx0FXaIme_tpIw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4183415.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vY1uRFe9AsokBnfOcljWLQ__original/img/o3jlxF05eD6TK3yucRvrwXWuRNg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4183415.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Japan', 'Islands: Marianas (USA)', 'Series: Company Scale System']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Ross Mortell', 'Adam Starkweather']", "artists": "['Antonio Pinar']", "publishers": "['Compass Games']", "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nThe decision to invade The Marianas (of which Saipan is a part) was not an easy one. General MacArthur still favored the more westerly route through the Philippines and had support amongst the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It took several conferences and nearly a year before the decision was made. There were several reasons that the Americans finally decided to invade the Marianas: Firstly, it was the most direct route to Japan, Secondly, they could base B29 bombers there which could bomb Tokyo, Thirdly, Saipan would be the first piece of prewar Japanese soil taken during the war. Lastly, the American planners hoped that they could draw the Japanese fleet into a decisive engagement. With all these reasons, a battle for the Marianas was inevitable.\n\nOn 15th June 1944 71,000 American Marines and Infantry attempted to make the plan work. 32,000 dug-in Japanese attempted to stop them.\n\nSaipan \u2013 The Bloody Rock will be the first game to utilize the new Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 2 maps. This will be your chance to experience a full-on naval invasion as Amtracs and DUKWs head towards the emplaced forces of Imperial Japan.\n\nThe game will come with 4 scenarios and 2 campaign games:\n\nDog-Day \u2013 The first day of the Invasion. It is 8 turns long and fought on a single map. An excellent introduction to both the system and the game.\n\nFirst Week in Hell \u2013 The first week of the invasion and the capture of Aslito airfield. This scenario is 56 turns long and is played on a single map. For the space but not time challenged players among you.\n\nDeath Valley \u2013 This scenario covers a single day of the fighting and concentrates on the American attempt to capture Mount Tapotchau and the area that became know as Death Valley. 8 turns long and a single map. An excellent large battle you can play over one sitting.\n\nShattered Jewels - This scenario covers a single day of fighting and revolves around the largest Banzai attack of the war. Thousands of Japanese attack the 105th Regiment near the town of Tanapag. Variable length but usually 4-5 turns.\n\nThe Battle for Saipan \u2013 The full historical campaign from 15th June- 9th July (224 Turns). This game covers the full fight for Saipan in 1944, from the first invasion at Charan Kanoa in the south, through the long bloody fight in the central mountains around Mount Tapotchao and finally to the last Japanese stand in the north.\n\nBloody Rock \u2013 This is a hypothetical campaign game that lets the players decide how to defend Saipan and how to invade it. The American player receives the same historical forces but now has the opportunity to devise his own landing schedule over one of 25 beaches. The Japanese player gets to prepare his own defenses; set up pillboxes, lay mines and deploy 6\u201d naval guns etc. Can you do better than history?\n\nComplexity: 6\n\nSolitaire Suitability:8\n\nTime Scale: 1 turn = 2 hours\n\nMap Scale: 1 hex = 500 meters\n\nUnit Scale: Companies and below\n\nPlayers: Best with 2 players but can be played with up to 4 players as well as solitaire\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2017.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 2100.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 2100.0, "minage": 13.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 77, 'average': 8.05351, 'bayesaverage': 5.59119, 'stddev': 1.29088, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 404, 'trading': 7, 'wanting': 33, 'wishing': 92, 'numcomments': 40, 'numweights': 6, 'averageweight': 4.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8125}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 983}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '4+': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 77.0, "average": 8.05351, "bayesaverage": 5.59119, "stddev": 1.29088, "median": 0.0, "owned": 404.0, "trading": 7.0, "wanting": 33.0, "wishing": 92.0, "numcomments": 40.0, "numweights": 6.0, "averageweight": 4.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8125}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 983}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 183489, "name": "Dungeon Hack: Dungeon Construction", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CtGRQ3C0RXDZCqAVLrzhRA__thumb/img/9dHAikOX19TfrPsuSI9y_SK_QQI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2795573.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CtGRQ3C0RXDZCqAVLrzhRA__original/img/IWHUqCC376M_i0l97-sJqnR_RtQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2795573.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Fantasy', 'Print & Play']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Role Playing']", "designers": "['Joseph Propati']", "artists": "['Joseph Propati']", "publishers": "['(Web published)']", "description": "Dungeon Hack: Dungeon Construction is the ultimate dungeon creator!

A multitude of cards depict and define the monsters, treasures, encounters, and obstacles you will face within the dungeon.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2015.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 2000.0, "minplaytime": 30.0, "maxplaytime": 2000.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 2, 'average': 6.5, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.5, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 7, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 11, 'numcomments': 3, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 2.0, "average": 6.5, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.5, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 11.0, "numcomments": 3.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 41850, "name": "Star Saga: One \u2013 Beyond The Boundary", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MvixY1FUDRYGBY-Odjw_ZQ__thumb/img/AAFzwVYvOhKg90bQE3ihOFmzgjQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic470525.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MvixY1FUDRYGBY-Odjw_ZQ__original/img/WFBM5IQNeMq3e2YXsBQ2GJumGBo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic470525.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Components: Digital Hybrid \u2013 App/Website Required']", "categories": "['Adventure', 'Science Fiction']", "implementations": "['Star Saga: Two \u2013 The Clathran Menace']", "mechanics": "['Action Queue', 'Storytelling', 'Trading']", "designers": "['Rick Dutton', 'Walter Freitag', 'Andrew C.

Greenberg (co-creator of Wizardry), Rick Dutton, Walter Freitag, and Michael Massimilla.[2] In this first title, players leave their homeworlds setting out to explore the vast unknowns of space. Per the official game text:\n\nIn 2815 A.D., the majority of the human race is afraid of space. They are cloistered in the Nine Worlds (Earth and eight colonized planets) in a region called the Galactic Fringe. Even though space travel has been practical since the invention of the dual-axis hyperdrive in 2257, humankind's attempt to colonize \"Beyond the Boundary\" came to an abrupt halt in 2490. The \"Space Plague,\" a gargantuan epidemic caused by an organism of alien origin, killed more than half the humanoid population of the galaxy, threatened the extinction of civilization, and forever changed mankind's attitude towards space.\n\nNow, a Space Patrol enforces the \"Boundary,\" that one-way border around the Nine Worlds in order to prevent anything like the \"Space Plague\" from ever happening again. Now, anyone may leave the area enclosed by the Boundary, but they may not return.\n\nThus far, the Boundary has proven effective in keeping ships from entering the Nine Worlds for three centuries, keeping humanity safe from the unknown. Of course, this does provide for a bit of stagnation, as well. After all, no new discoveries, no new challenges, and countless lost opportunities hardly seem compatible with a growing standard of living. Finally, there are those who sense that something is amiss... \"\n\nThe game is unique in the fact that it is a boardgame in which the computer acts as a moderator and tracks resources.\n\n Reimplemented by: \n\n\n     Star Saga: Two \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Clathran Menace\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1988.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 3600.0, "minplaytime": 240.0, "maxplaytime": 3600.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 16, 'average': 8.03125, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 1.82405, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 34, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 4, 'wishing': 18, 'numcomments': 6, 'numweights': 5, 'averageweight': 2.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 16.0, "average": 8.03125, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 1.82405, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 4.0, "wishing": 18.0, "numcomments": 6.0, "numweights": 5.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 11042, "name": "Barbarossa: Game of the Russo-German War 1941-45", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SqKo9EFrs_00g3C4n0Bi8Q__thumb/img/h3UWxiwpGiPeEtVA1-VxTG7pOXU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic178481.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SqKo9EFrs_00g3C4n0Bi8Q__original/img/shL33naM3GL5hf2uJ977gypsX3Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic178481.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Players: Two Player Only Games']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Ratio / Combat Results Table', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['David James Ritchie']", "artists": "['Ivor M.

The full campaign opens with the abdication of Emperor Diocletian (305 A.D.) and continues to the death of Julian the Apostate (in the 360's or 370's - the date is variable). Scenarios cover shorter periods, such as the fateful war between Constantine the Great and Licinius (313-324).\n\nThe map shows the Roman Empire in 305, divided into zones that, in turn, are grouped into 12 Dioceses, the Imperial administrative districts of that time. Surrounding the Empire are the zones of barbarian peoples and the rival Persian Empire. A turn is one year. Units have Points de Force (Strength Points) representing about 1,000 men each. Roman units come in three types: Ripenses, who cannot leave their home diocese, Pseudo-Comitatenses, whose ability to range far from home is limited, and Comitatenses, who can go anywhere in the Empire and beyond.\n\nThe opposing sides are unusual and may puzzle players who know little or nothing about this era. One player (dubbed \"Primus\") represents the senior Emperor (\"Primus Augustus\") and his allies, who may include another Augustus, one or two Caesars (junior Emperors), other Roman generals, and even non-Roman peoples. The other player (\"Secundus\", misspelled \"Secondus\" in the rules) has his own set of Augusti, Caesars, generals and non-Romans. An important limitation is that each Augustus and Caesar must have a capital of his own, and only six capital cites are available at the beginning of the game. A seventh, Constantinople, may be constructed, though its advent is not a certainty. (Rome, by the way, is not one of the capitals; its political importance had long since faded.)\n\nIn the course of play, Primus and Secundus may swap positions as the result of either a successful usurpation plotted by the Secundus or the death of the Primus Augustus without an Augustus or Caesar to succeed him. In general, it is better to be Primus than Secundus, but it isn't impossible for a perpetual Secundus to win.\n\nThe Roman leaders are historical figures (38 in all), who enter the game at the same time as in actuality and run an increasing risk of death from natural causes if they aren't killed off sooner. Names are rendered in their French versions, e. g., \"Constance Chlore\" for Constantius Chlorus. A Leader is rated for \"Capacit\u00e9 de Commandement\" (number of units he can command), \"Capacit\u00e9 Politique\" (a variety of functions, such as determination of the initiative each turn), \"Valeur Strat\u00e9gique\" (ability to evade combat plus other functions) and \"Bonus Tactique\" (useful in battles). Many Leaders are also marked as Christian or Pagan, though religion has much less of an impact than it did in real life.\n\nVery important to play are \"stratagems\", which make it possible to embark on a usurpation against the other player, assassinate rival Leaders, spread plagues, trigger barbarian uprisings, pacify barbarians already at war with the Empire, inspire desertions from enemy ranks, and much else.\n\nTurns have a variable number of movement/combat phases, determined by adding the valeurs strat\u00e9giques of the Primus Augustus and the highest rated Leader in the Secundus camp. The pace of the game thus depends on the quality of the current Leaders.\n\nMovement and combat are straightforward. Leaders, accompanied by a number of units up to their capacit\u00e9 de commandement, may move up to four zones, halting and fighting when they encounter enemies. Units without Leaders may move only one zone at a time. Battles are often bloody, but weakened or eliminated units quickly return  to full strength.\n\nPlayers tally Victory Points at the end of each Turn. The list of achievements that garner VP's is long: victory in major battles (35 PF's or more engaged), control of Dioceses, defeat of non-Romans, presence of non-Roman troops in the other player's controlled territory, and so on.\n\nPlayers must mount and cut the game's counters themselves, which is a non-trivial task. As a minor annoyance, the counters are a bit too big for the zones on the map. The rules are in French, though English translations are easy to find.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2004.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 1200.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 44, 'average': 7.62273, 'bayesaverage': 5.54161, 'stddev': 1.2845, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 255, 'trading': 3, 'wanting': 5, 'wishing': 12, 'numcomments': 28, 'numweights': 10, 'averageweight': 3.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 11785}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2068}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 1, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 44.0, "average": 7.62273, "bayesaverage": 5.54161, "stddev": 1.2845, "median": 0.0, "owned": 255.0, "trading": 3.0, "wanting": 5.0, "wishing": 12.0, "numcomments": 28.0, "numweights": 10.0, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 11785}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2068}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 368184, "name": "The Greatest Day: Utah Beach", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HopW4Zi0D9ADTKNq5mTGPg__thumb/img/Y35aj9q6pqRBzVYofeTeeiugkEE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7131321.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HopW4Zi0D9ADTKNq5mTGPg__original/img/5yfhTgBpsNyy9VKwVk0z9Amk5TM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7131321.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Upcoming Releases']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Joe Chacon', 'Vincent Lefavrais', 'Adam Starkweather']", "artists": "['Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi']", "publishers": "['Multi-Man Publishing']", "description": "The Greatest Day: Utah Beach is the second of three volumes in the Grand Tactical Series that covers the Battle for Normandy in June of 1944.\n The Greatest Day: Utah Beach includes a wide array of scenarios from the beach landings, to airborne troops seizing Carentan, to cutting the Cotentin Peninsula.

The Japanese seized the area in 1931 on the fabricated pretext of Chinese aggression known as the Mukden Incident.  In truth, the Japanese desired the region (known as Manchuria) for its extensive wealth of minerals.  The Japanese attempted to bring large numbers of settlers into the area to colonize and farm and during the Japanese occupation Manchukuo\u2019s industrial base expanded rapidly.  Cities, factories and railways were modernized.  Between 1938 and 1942 about 200,000 Japanese farmers immigrated to Manchukuo.  The Soviets reportedly captured and repatriated 850,000 Japanese settlers after their invasion of Manchukuo in 1945.  The Japanese used Manchuria to prepare for war, creating industry and infrastructure to support their planned conquest of Asia.\n\nResistance to the Japanese occupation grew with time.  By 1935 a combination of anti-Japanese forces including Communists and Korean resistance fighters totaling about 40,000 men formed into armies.  The Communist Chinese (CCP) operated guerilla units inside the occupied territory that targeted Japanese occupiers but also spread the social ideals of the party. Until 1937 resistance fighters engaged in anti-government operations designed to subvert Japanese governance.  After the war began these fighters presented a serious threat to the Japanese and Manchukuo government who were continually forced to use their troops to deal with them.  It took until 1942 for the Japanese to pacify the region.\n\nThe Japanese were not without competition; the Soviet Union had long had designs on Manchuria.   The Japanese and Soviets fought a number of border skirmishes between 1935 and 1939.\n\nWelcome to Manchukuo!  A battleground of occupiers, liberators, and revolutionaries!  In the expansion set Manchukuo your alliance will battle for the control of resources, industry and ultimately, the destiny of this important region.\n\nSET CONTENTS\n\n\u2022    Manchukuo Nation Roundel (x5)\n\u2022    CCP Nation Roundel (x3)\n\u2022    Infantry (x6)\n\u2022    Motorized Infantry (x1)\n\u2022    BA-6 Armored Car (x1)\n\u2022    Cavalry (Painted) x1\n\u2022    Artillery (x2)\n\u2022    Militia Marker (x2)\n\u2022    Manchukuo Imperial Guard Marker (x1)\n\u2022    Kwangtung Army Marker (x4)\n\u2022    Patrol River Boat Marker (x2)\n\u2022    Minor Factory Marker (x2)\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[{'id': '188364', 'name': 'Global War 1936-1945 (Second Edition)'}, {'id': '258347', 'name': 'Global War 1936-1945 (Third Edition)'}]", "yearpublished": 2016.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 9.0, "playingtime": 1080.0, "minplaytime": 360.0, "maxplaytime": 1080.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 2, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '7': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '8': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '9': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '9+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "9+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 62258, "name": "Fatal Alliances: The Great War 1914-1918", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pYrAMItecIMYkipztEAvWw__thumb/img/91PQoE-UQZGVX6BZGZUTqmpp-4Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2673386.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pYrAMItecIMYkipztEAvWw__original/img/wfj6ureQ9iO0WwEKGEz_3WioCDw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2673386.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Continents: Africa', 'Continents: Asia', 'Continents: Europe', 'Continents: North America', 'Continents: South America', 'Country: Austria-Hungary', 'Country: Bulgaria', 'Country: China', 'Country: France', 'Country: Germany', 'Country: Italy', 'Country: Japan', 'Country: Mexico', 'Country: Ottoman Empire', 'Country: Russia', 'Country: Serbia', 'Country: United Kingdom', 'Country: USA', 'Region: The World', 'Series: World in Flames (ADG)']", "categories": "['Aviation / Flight', 'Nautical', 'Wargame', 'World War I']", "implementations": "['Fatal Alliances II']", "mechanics": "['Area Movement', 'Delayed Purchase', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Ratio / Combat Results Table', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation', 'Variable Set-up', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Andrew Rader', 'Harry Rowland']", "artists": "['Mark Mahaffey', 'Andrew Rader']", "publishers": "['Compass Games']", "description": "\"Fatal Alliances: The Great War 1914-1918\" is a World War I version of World in Flames. Like its predecessor, Fatal Alliances is all encompassing and represents every theater and aspect of the First World War. Fatal Alliances expands upon the military system of World in Flames to highlight the diplomatic and civilian fronts.\n\nWhen we think of the First World War, we often think of miles of static trenches stretching along the Western Front. Indeed trench warfare was a huge component of the war, but many theaters in the Middle East, Russia, the Balkans, and even Africa were very dynamic \u2013 as even the Western Front was at times. Moreover, Fatal Alliances focuses on the major technological changes the war brought on, on land, at sea, and in the air. In order to prevail on the battlefield, you must coordinate artillery, elite ace-led air forces, gas units, shock troops, engineering units, infantry, cavalry, and early tanks.\n\nThe First World War was truly global, and in Fatal Alliances, the Eastern Front, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Africa, and even Asia and the Americas play a major role. German forces are loose in Africa, and South Africa's loyalty is uncertain. Italy will go to the highest bidder. The Ottomans face Russians in the Caucasus and British Forces along the Suez Canal. China is in turmoil, and could potentially join either side. Japan is nominally an Ally, but Japanese expansionism is already at odds with the interests of other Allied powers. Russia is primed for revolution, with Bolsheviks facing Tsarist forces in a battle for control of the largest swath of land in Eurasia.\n\nTo guide your nation to victory, you must navigate the world of international politics, swaying both minor and major powers to your side. Can you survive civil unrest or military revolution at home, while instigating it abroad? Can you prevent your troops from refusing to fight, and maintain control of your far-flung colonies? Strategic warfare on the seas and in the air must form a vital part of your strategy, preserving your nation\u2019s own will to fight while degrading the enemy\u2019s. Whatever your strategy, Fatal Alliances: The Great War is a truly dynamic and all-encompassing simulation of every theater of the First World War.\n\n1680 counters represent the armies, navies, and air forces, which fought in the Great War. Two to five players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations. What forces to produce, where to commit them, when, and how? No two games of Fatal Alliances play the same, no strategy is foolproof, and any decision may have unforeseen consequences.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2016.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 240.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 100, 'average': 8.03, 'bayesaverage': 5.59343, 'stddev': 1.71, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 427, 'trading': 10, 'wanting': 35, 'wishing': 136, 'numcomments': 52, 'numweights': 14, 'averageweight': 4.1429, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8009}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1087}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 9, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 6, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '6': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '6+': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 4}}}", "usersrated": 100.0, "average": 8.03, "bayesaverage": 5.59343, "stddev": 1.71, "median": 0.0, "owned": 427.0, "trading": 10.0, "wanting": 35.0, "wishing": 136.0, "numcomments": 52.0, "numweights": 14.0, "averageweight": 4.1429, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 8009}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1087}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 163074, "name": "Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe", "alternative_names": "['Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe, September 1944 - April 1945']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ROTsj__-mb0qn144S9s-Dw__thumb/img/IZ03RbmOG4U5bpo3xyzRegWNTfk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3204038.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ROTsj__-mb0qn144S9s-Dw__original/img/7NfFwzqrlptbylHkmuzdZV98peA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3204038.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Belgium', 'Country: France', 'Country: Germany', 'Country: Luxembourg', 'Country: Netherlands', 'History: World War II (Battle of the Bulge)', 'Series: Operational Combat Series (MMP)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['Dean Essig', 'John Kisner', 'Roland LeBlanc']", "artists": "['Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi', 'Dean Essig']", "publishers": "['Multi-Man Publishing']", "description": "Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe, September 1944 - April 1945, begins with the German Army reeling from a string of near-fatal defeats, and in full retreat to the safety of the West Wall where it hopes to make a stand.

Allied material superiority is (mostly) balanced by German tenacity, rugged terrain, and lousy weather. Defensive-minded players will be happiest playing the Germans, but players of all temperaments will discover that there is still plenty of torque left in the Axis even at this late stage of the war. The Allies will not cross the Rhine without a tough fight!\n\nBeyond the Rhine is a big game, with 3.5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. At this scale the various Western Front battles\u2014Market-Garden, H\u00fcrtgen, Bulge, Nordwind, Remagen, etc.\u2014have an operational ebb and flow, but can also be viewed in relation to the whole front. A comprehensive game like this one, covering the entire Western Front, was long overdue.\n\nSpecial rules in this 14th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this fascinating campaign. They include:\n\nRandom events similar to what are found in the award-winning DAK. These cover things like Fuel Shortages, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, Lost Couriers, Railway Strikes, and Dambuster Raids. The 58 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.\nThe importance and difficulty of the Rhine crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and pontoons to be emplaced.\nBackground effects of Allied air interdiction are simple and elegant (built into the Terrain Effects Chart and Weather), but the player does have the option to switch some of these planes to normal barrages and sweeps.\nThe strategic significance of the Ruhr and the Saar, of clearing the left bank of the Rhine, and of major ports such as Antwerp are reflected by simple economic effects and the game\u2019s \u201cBroadfront\u201d restrictions on US supply placement and usage.\nThe Wacht am Rhein counter-offensive is recreated by simple mechanics for off-map buildup and operational surprise.\nMany options are included for players wanting even more realism. For instance, there are rules for German Kampfgruppen and extra restrictions on the plethora of Allied independent units.\nBeyond the Rhine features three monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,000 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including a 9-turn Bulge game played on a special map (otherwise, portions of all four maps would be needed).\n\nGrand Campaign: 4 maps, 70 turns\nFall of \u201844 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 26 turns\nFall of \u201844 (Bradley): 2 maps, 26 turns\nOperation Queen: 1 map, 9 turns\nBulge Campaign: 4 maps, 40 turns\nA Time for Trumpets: 1 map, 9 turns\nNordwind: 1 map, 13 turns\nEndkampf Campaign: 4 maps, 24 turns\nSpring of \u201845 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 24 turns\nSpring of \u201845 (Bradley): 2 maps, 24 turns.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1/2 Week\nHex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km \nUnits: Company to Corps\n\nGame Inventory:\nFive 22\" X 34\" mapsheets\nEight countersheets (2,240 1/2\" dual-side printed counters)\nOne 48 page OCS rules booklet\nOne 64 page Beyond the Rhine game rules booklet\nTwo 4 page OCS Charts & Tables folders\nTwo 8 page Beyond the Rhine Charts & Tables folders (one each for Allied & Axis)\nThree Player Aid Cards (1 sided)\nTwo 6-sided dice\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2015.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 0.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 3000.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 15.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 171, 'average': 8.46404, 'bayesaverage': 5.70342, 'stddev': 1.34289, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 916, 'trading': 18, 'wanting': 33, 'wishing': 129, 'numcomments': 104, 'numweights': 14, 'averageweight': 4.4286, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 5176}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 401}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'0+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 171.0, "average": 8.46404, "bayesaverage": 5.70342, "stddev": 1.34289, "median": 0.0, "owned": 916.0, "trading": 18.0, "wanting": 33.0, "wishing": 129.0, "numcomments": 104.0, "numweights": 14.0, "averageweight": 4.4286, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 5176}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 401}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "0+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 316410, "name": "The Third World War: Designer Signature Edition", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_cf4pVu7VfaxLYBOls8c0w__thumb/img/EVQSM5AFE1xq1o86Lcm7cVrhYWw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5580879.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_cf4pVu7VfaxLYBOls8c0w__original/img/K2MqYqfX38c8yxSzOU2lAlHE7Ks=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5580879.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Continents: Europe', 'History: Cold War', 'Political: NATO', 'Region: Middle East', 'Series: Designer Signature Edition (Compass Games)', 'Theme: Alternate History']", "categories": "['Modern Warfare', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "['Arctic Front: Battle for Norway', 'Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East', 'Southern Front: Race for the Turkish Straits', 'The Third World War: Battle for Germany']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['Frank Chadwick']", "artists": "['Bruce Yearian']", "publishers": "['Compass Games']", "description": "The Third World War, Designer Signature Edition\n\nThis edition of The Third World War features many new enhancements and larger counters and is another Classic Reborn!\n\nThe complete Third World War game series is included which is comprised of the following four games:\n\n     Third World War (subtitled Battle for Germany) is a game of the struggle for central Europe by the forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\n     Southern Front: Race for the Turkish Straits adds Bulgaria and Romania, reinforced with three Soviet armies and special-capability forces, face Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, thinly reinforced with a few elite units from the U.S., France, and Italy.\n     Arctic Front: Battle for Norway covers the Soviet Leningrad Front, with its special airborne, amphibious, and arctic-equipped contingents, assault of Norway, reinforced with a few elite units from the U.S., Britain, Canada, and other NATO nations.\n     Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East includes a special \"game within a game\", covering the diplomatic, political, and military maneuvers by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Middle East before -

With roots tracing back to the classic Third Reich, and its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War pushes this gaming system even further, expanding on the detail and choices of what was already a fine family of wargames.\n\n\nA World at War--the game that brings you everything in one meaty box, a far-ranging battlefield where marines and paratroopers slog it out with infantry and armor; where carriers and submarines spar with cruisers and battlewagons; where army planes and carrier planes crisscross the skies with bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide what to build, and you decide where to deploy it. Will this corps storm across Europe, or sail to the Pacific? Will these planes patrol The Steppes, or hunt the shores of the Med? Choose carefully--for in A World at War, the deployment of troops is crucial. But don't go thinking armaments comprise the only battlefield. The struggle extends deep into other arenas, like into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy, and into your skunk works, through research, and behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not just in drop tanks and detonators, but also in spy rings and wool parkas. Most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you'll tend to obsess over mistakes, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk. But now isn't the time for recriminations--now is the time for action! Will you gamble and surge-research the atomic bomb? Or will you take the exigency--less glitzy and less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? Whatever you decide, decide carefully, for this is bare-knuckled warfare not only across land, sea, and air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on lab benches and in diplomatic pouches. With so many elements in play, can winning strategies ever be more than a cobble or winning choices ever more than an anguish? It's a question only you can answer. But whatever your approach, if you hang on long enough to unleash your final hoard of weapons in one last grand assault, you just may earn that rare chance to annihilate armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2003.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 8.0, "playingtime": 2880.0, "minplaytime": 1440.0, "maxplaytime": 2880.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 349, 'average': 7.58754, 'bayesaverage': 5.7392, 'stddev': 2.07839, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1425, 'trading': 43, 'wanting': 96, 'wishing': 440, 'numcomments': 231, 'numweights': 106, 'averageweight': 4.8396, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4673}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 516}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 25, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 8}, '2': {'best_rating': 6, 'recommended_rating': 6, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '3': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '4': {'best_rating': 11, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '5': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 6, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}, '6': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 5}, '7': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 10}, '8': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 8}, '8+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 9}}}", "usersrated": 349.0, "average": 7.58754, "bayesaverage": 5.7392, "stddev": 2.07839, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1425.0, "trading": 43.0, "wanting": 96.0, "wishing": 440.0, "numcomments": 231.0, "numweights": 106.0, "averageweight": 4.8396, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4673}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 516}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 135960, "name": "Time of Decisions", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Unreleased Games', 'Components: Block Wargames', 'Continents: Africa', 'Continents: Asia', 'Continents: Europe', 'Series: Blocks (VentoNuovo)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Emanuele Santandrea']", "artists": "['Emanuele Santandrea']", "publishers": "['VentoNuovo Games']", "description": "TIME of DECISIONS is the last game of the Blocks Series from VentoNuovo Games.\n\nIt covers the early years before WW2, including war in Ethiopia, Spain, Aunschluss, Invasion of Cechoslovakia...\n\nTIME of DECISIONS is a game of World War II conflict simulation at the strategic level.

The Americans can invade North Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia at their own political risk - as can the Communist player.\n\n-description from designer\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2019.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 150.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 37, 'average': 6.45135, 'bayesaverage': 5.51343, 'stddev': 2.54661, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 210, 'trading': 11, 'wanting': 16, 'wishing': 54, 'numcomments': 34, 'numweights': 8, 'averageweight': 4.25, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 16712}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 3119}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 6, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '4': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '4+': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 37.0, "average": 6.45135, "bayesaverage": 5.51343, "stddev": 2.54661, "median": 0.0, "owned": 210.0, "trading": 11.0, "wanting": 16.0, "wishing": 54.0, "numcomments": 34.0, "numweights": 8.0, "averageweight": 4.25, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 16712}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 3119}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 364538, "name": "Witchbound", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kwCufndC_czcCxPhtNdTrg__thumb/img/aZKcTlYR0qaxj-WdgiYCJquAK-c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6982086.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kwCufndC_czcCxPhtNdTrg__original/img/ElO-H_GXl7uMH0U7ztblnc3HD-A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6982086.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Upcoming Releases']", "categories": "['Adventure', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Puzzle']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Push Your Luck', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']", "designers": "['Thatcher Cohen']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['Dark Doll Games']", "description": "Witchbound is a story based adventure game for 1-2 players in which you will explore a magical island, cast spells, craft potions, overcome obstacles, defeat monsters, meet interesting characters, and uncover secrets.\n\nAs the child of the most famous adventuring couple in the kingdom, you are surely destined to be a great adventurer like them, or so you thought. Your parents embark on a far away quest, so you are sent to stay with your grandmother who lives on an island called Coven Cove; the fabled island of witches. Unfortunately there are no real witches anymore and the island has become a mere tourist attraction. That is, until you find a spellbook and accidentally awaken your own magic. The problem is, witches are magically bound to the island, and you just became one. To undo this tragedy, you\u2019ll need to explore the island and uncover the source of the magic that binds you. You may however uncover more than you bargained for, as the island keeps a dark secret.\n\nThis is a campaign style game that is played over many sessions. The story is divided into chapters, each with its own objectives for the player.\n\nThe island is divided into scenes that the player will explore 1 page at a time from the map book. Each scene is full of numbered points of interest (POI), some of which are clearly visible while some are hidden. The player interacts with these POI\u2019s by combining the action number of an item, ability, or clue they have gained during play. These combined numbers refer to a narrative entry in the story book. The entries can lead to the discovery of new locations, items, abilities, or helpful hints. While exploring the various scenes, the player will encounter obstacles and enemies that block their path. They will need to use the right item/skill when interacting with these obstacles to progress.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2022.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 15.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1, 'average': 9.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 2, 'numcomments': 1, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 1.0, "average": 9.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 2.0, "numcomments": 1.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 210417, "name": "US & German Ordinance Set #1", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Players: Two Player Only Games']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Simulation']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['Historical Board Gaming']", "description": "This set features a number of new ordnance for use with Global War 2nd edition.

Carthage concentrates on Punic events that take place in Carthage/Africa as well as Sicily, with the main scenario being the massive First Punic War. Building on the popular mechanics and systems of Rise of the Roman Republic (Vol I), Carthage includes the full, advances naval system, with galley battles, fleet building expanding ports, and everything featured in the unusual, truly naval war that was the First Punic War. In addition, the detailed political systems for both powers, the soul of the game and a set of mechanics that truly puts the players in the heart of ongoing events, are expanded and clarified. With the addition of rules for the Reduction and Repair of city defenses, militia, and the ability of garrisons to Sally, sieges are now more than just sideshows.\n\nCarthage still uses The Ancient World's unique combat system, with its unusual Unpredictable Results, elephants, cavalry pursuit, and the dangers of fighting too many battles. Carthage's main scenario is, of course, the First Punic War, a twenty year affair that will take some time to play, but keep you entranced for years. The game also includes quick, one evening scenarios, including the playtester two-turn favorite Hiero; Hero or Gyro?, the twisty opening year of the First Punic War. We also have short scenarios for the first invasion of Carthage by Agathocles of Syracuse (311 BC) and the infamous Mercenary War that erupted in Carthage right after the First Punic War (241 BC).\n\nCarthage contains one full-sized map - the slightly redone Italy map (we've expanded rivers to a three-tiered system and corrected some tangential map errata) - plus a half-map for Carthage and Africa. The 1000+ full-color counters include every Roman magistrate of the era plus lots of Libyans, Numidians, Egyptians, Iberians, Celts ... if they were there, they're in this game. Also, part of the game package is a expanded group of play-aid charts, prompted by playtester insistence, to help keep track of the many details that campaigning can require.\nCarthage is the Punic War's game that ancients and gaming aficionados have been waiting for since the beginning of the wargame hobby. Detailed and demanding, it provides players with a highly playable leel of insight, decision-making, and just pure Fun.\n\nGame Features\nTIME SCALE     1 year per turn\nMAP SCALE     13 miles per hex\nUNIT SCALE      Strength point = either 500 men; 300 cavalry; 10 elephants\n\nDesigner: Richard Berg\nDeveloper: Alan Ray\nArt Director: Rodger B.

Each hexagon represents an area approximately 100 meters across. The armies which fought on this ground are represented by over 700 multi-colored playing pieces. Infantry are in regimental or battalion organization. Cavalry are shown as regiments. Artillery is deployed by battery. Distinctions are made between line or light infantry, guard and other elite forces. Various leaders are also portrayed.\nEach unit is individually rated according to its number of men or guns, its morale, its ability to initiate combat though gunfire or m\u00eal\u00e9e, its movement and, where appropriate, its range.\nThe game is ideal for solitary study or team play. Each turn is twenty minutes of real and simulated time, play balance depends entirely on the skill of the players.\nThe rules are a revision of the award-winning system developed by the Marshal Enterprises Household and cover the full range of features characteristic of the Napoleonic Battlefield.

Hitler issued goals that ranged from the far oil fields to a city on the Volga by the name of Stalingrad, finally deciding not to decide and ordered the far flung Army Group to divide and go for both.\n\nAcross endless steppe, in the blazing sun and freezing cold, the Axis legions advanced to the edge of Asia and the Caucasus mountains. Some of the oil fields, and most of the city were taken.\n\nThen the Red Army had its turn...\n\nCase Blue is a game that covers both the Axis advance (1941 and 1942) as well as the Soviet counterattacks (Nov 42 to Jan 43) and the German counteroffensive at Kharkov (Feb-March 1943) that ended the series of campaigns in the south. The game covers in great detail all the operations from October 1941 until May 1943 on a large play area extending from Voronezh almost to the Turkish border. The full scope and grandiose nature of these operations come to life here.\n\nCase Blue covers and replaces the 1994 award winning game Enemy at the Gates. Players get to encircle Stalingrad, run their pocket and relief attempts and the many operations that game covered.\n\nCase Blue is the 10th game in the award winning Operational Combat System and is the result of over 6 years of intensive research and testing. Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions (OK, there are a few very strange companies), making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work.\n\nCase Blue is designed to be played both separately or linked to the 2001 game Guderian's Blitzkrieg II. The monster linked game allows players to run operations on the entire Eastern Front (except for Leningrad) from the fall of 1941 until mid-1943.\n\nMultiple scenarios (one map to very large) allow play to be picked up at various key points in the campaign.\n\nIf you want a serious look at these pivotal campaigns while having fun at the same time, this is the game for you.\n\nPerhaps the Operational Combat System finest hour, this game is huge.\n\nGame Scale:\n\n    Game Turn: Half Week\n    Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km\n    Units: Company to Division\n\n\nGame Inventory:\n\n    Nine 22 x 34\" full-color mapsheets (Maps A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K)\n    One 14 x 22\" full-color mapsheet (Map E)\n    Ten dual-side printed countersheets (2,660 1/2\" Unit counters)\n    Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2\" Marker counters)\n    One 48-page OCS v4.0 series rules booklet\n    One 16-page Case Blue game rules booklet\n    One 80-page Case Blue Scenario Book 1\n    One 48-page Case Blue Scenario Book 2\n    One 24-page Case Blue Axis Booklet\n    One 24-page Case Blue Russian Booklet\n    Two 4-page two-color OCS v4.0 Charts & Tables booklets\n    Two 6-sided dice\n\n\n(from MMP web site:)\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2007.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 22500.0, "minplaytime": 1440.0, "maxplaytime": 22500.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 307, 'average': 8.27228, 'bayesaverage': 5.83553, 'stddev': 1.87112, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 750, 'trading': 5, 'wanting': 126, 'wishing': 414, 'numcomments': 154, 'numweights': 69, 'averageweight': 4.5797, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3700}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 175}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 24, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 7}, '2': {'best_rating': 8, 'recommended_rating': 6, 'not_recommended_rating': 4}, '2+': {'best_rating': 11, 'recommended_rating': 8, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 307.0, "average": 8.27228, "bayesaverage": 5.83553, "stddev": 1.87112, "median": 0.0, "owned": 750.0, "trading": 5.0, "wanting": 126.0, "wishing": 414.0, "numcomments": 154.0, "numweights": 69.0, "averageweight": 4.5797, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3700}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 175}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 207769, "name": "Ostfront: Fast Play WWII Wargame", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7lARRRW-ByTxojRiIMSfVQ__thumb/img/TdNBCvos957QzzzcyX4Zc-tj9Is=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3159615.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7lARRRW-ByTxojRiIMSfVQ__original/img/p5PlefrLWkVyjXa9naUbGxJTF_w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3159615.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Mechanism: Campaign Games']", "categories": "['Book', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Measurement Movement', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['Tom Jensen']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['Ostfront Publishing']", "description": "Game description from the publisher:\n\nOstfront is the result of 5 years of research and play-testing. Its a comprehensive World War 2 system aimed at historical accuracy, balance and fun. The rules have been streamlined over the years, and we would consider it \"fast play\" - Its quick, brutal and rewards bold commanders with sound tactics.\n\nOstfront covers Infantry, Light Vehicles, all varieties of Tanks and Self-Propelled guns, Artillery in the form of Field Guns and Howitzers, Air Support and Air defense, as well various other forms of support and fortifications. It can be played in any theater of WW2, from North Africa to the Pacific. Aimed at 1/72, 1/100 or smaller scale miniatures. It would also work fine for 28mm.\n\nThe Ostfront system is all about combined arms - it plays at a Company to Battalion level, with the smallest unit being the Infantry Platoon. Infantry are deployed in bases, each one representing about 25 men for regulars, and about 10 men for the veteran Assault Infantry units. At 1/72 scale we usually use 3-4 miniatures per base, meaning you can make a large amount of bases from any cheap infantry box - one airfix box of 48 miniatures would give you 10 bases.\n\nTanks are of course a large part of Ostfront battles, with the average game fielding anywhere from 1 to 20 of them per side, sometimes more in larger games. Light vehicles play an important role, and reconnaissance has a tangible effect in-game - he who scouts out the area first can gain a tactical advantage.\n\nWe Split WW2 into 3 periods, allowing balanced battles to be fought and still capture the feelings of operations like Barbarossa and Operation Torch. Its not always about who has the most heavy tanks - in fact heavy tanks are somewhat expensive in the points system, due to the difficulty with which they were produced, maintained and transported. During early war players will need to rely on light tanks, Infantry, Artillery and air strikes to secure their objectives. Mid war covers Kursk style battles - with the Tiger, Panther and Sherman all making an appearance, but before heavier Soviet tanks like the IS-2 or T-34/85 had come into action. Late war covers all the late war toys, from the JagdTiger and Tiger II to the Pershing, to the aforementioned IS-2, among many others.\n\nOstfront also has a campaign system for combination map-and-tabletop play, allowing you to get that glorious combination of grand strategy and tabletop tactics. The campaign allows up to 5 players to go head-to-head on a map of Europe and North Africa, from Spain to Russia, Scandinavia to Egypt. Each faction fights to control production centres - where they produce more forces each turn, and to spread their supply lines out to the places they need to conquer. A technology race is also implemented, with players who control Tech Centres able to produce slightly more advanced units - even extending to post war tanks if the game is currently in late war - ever wanted a good reason to use a Maus or IS-3? Well here's your chance.\n\nEvery time forces make contact on the Campaign map, an Ostfront tabletop battle is fought, with the amount of points on the campaign map dictating how many points you can use in your table top battle. After the battle the results are applied to the Campaign: if you lost 50% of your forces during the game, your force on the Campaign map will also lose 50%. If you were able to win the objectives and cut off your enemies supply train on the table, you will be able to force him back on the campaign map.\n\nThis connectedness makes each tabletop battle have a purpose, and adds a lot of flavor to the game as a whole. You might know you're horribly outnumbered, but you need to give the enemy force a bloody nose while you wait for your main force and your allies to come to your aid, and so you will build a specific list for that game, and that purpose. The campaign also allows for combined attacks, out-flanking maneuvers, encirclement and cutting off of supply lines, and a free-form diplomacy system is also implemented.\n\nTwo Campaign maps are available for free download, one is a balanced map for a slightly ahistorical but balanced campaign. The other is a realistic map for a  more accurate WW2 campaign.\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '298338', 'name': 'Ostfront: British Army List'}, {'id': '298340', 'name': 'Ostfront: Chinese Armies of the Second Sino-Japanese War'}, {'id': '298328', 'name': 'Ostfront: Fall Weiss \u2013 September 1939 - September 1940'}, {'id': '298339', 'name': 'Ostfront: Imperial Japanese Armed Forces and Pacific Scenarios'}, {'id': '298335', 'name': 'Ostfront: Royal Italian Army List'}, {'id': '298336', 'name': 'Ostfront: Soviet Army List'}, {'id': '298337', 'name': 'Ostfront: United States Armed Forces'}, {'id': '298331', 'name': 'Ostfront: Wehrmacht Army List'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2016.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 5.0, "playingtime": 1440.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 1440.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 2, 'average': 7.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 2.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 5, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 1, 'wishing': 1, 'numcomments': 2, 'numweights': 1, 'averageweight': 3.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 2.0, "average": 7.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 2.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 5.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 1.0, "wishing": 1.0, "numcomments": 2.0, "numweights": 1.0, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5+", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 243581, "name": "Bastille: Fallen Kingdoms", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Abstract Strategy', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Cooperative Game', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Push Your Luck', 'Role Playing']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Self-Published)']", "description": null, "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2017.0, "minplayers": 3.0, "maxplayers": 6.0, "playingtime": 1400.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 1400.0, "minage": 13.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 245831, "name": "Six Tigers Cards", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Card Game']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Trick-taking']", "designers": "['(Uncredited)']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Public Domain)']", "description": "\"Six Tigers\" Cards (\u00e5\u2026\u00ad\u00e8\u2122\u017d\u00e7\u2030\u0152) are traditional playing cards of the Hakka minority in China.

The deal changes each round depending on who won the previous.\n\nMost cards of this variety have only the characters for suit and number (in Hakka traditional form, not normal Chinese characters) although some larger, more elaborate decks may have illustrations.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 0.0, "minplayers": 3.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 9999.0, "minplaytime": 5.0, "maxplaytime": 9999.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 0, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 1, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 0.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 1.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 350046, "name": "Nobody's Cards", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Crowdfunding: Kickstarter']", "categories": "['Card Game']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Action/Event']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Self-Published)']", "description": "Play the game by drawing a card and improve the quality of your relationships with your family or friends.

The Army of the Potomac and its generals had failed the test of battle again and again. In September, Robert E. Lee invaded the North. One more victory might have turned the war in favor of the Confederacy.\n\nIn desperation, Lincoln placed George B. Mc-Clellan in command. The pursuing Union army caught up to the Confederates at Antietam Creek.\nWith the Confederates outnumbered 2 to 1, and on Union soil, McClellan had the chance to end the war in a single day. It was the bloodiest day in the history of America.

The first drive on St. Louis had been repulsed and Van Dorn was summoned to take command of the force and launch a new offensive into the heart of Missouri. Van Dorn, an Indian-fighting cavalryman by trade, arrived at the Rebel camp and even though he was quite ill (due to a fall into a river) he immediately roused the troops. He proposed to launch an immediate attack, despite the freezing weather and fatigued state of his troops. Van Dorn force-marched the army north and managed to pull off a classic Napoleonic stratagem - the \u201cmaneuver sur la derrieres\u201d. He placed his army astride the line of communications of his enemy and by any normal military measure this should have been settled the issue for the two armies. But by doing so at such an ill-advised time and at such an inhuman pace the Rebel troops were little more than a frozen and exhausted armed mob when they finally reached their positions. \n Brig. General Sam Curtis was not a man to be intimidated and he realized that he had a fighting chance, even in this seemingly impossible position. Perseverance and hard, smart fighting by men like Colonel Grenville Dodge and others turned what looked to be a potential disaster into a grand victory. The Battle of Pea Ridge secured for the Union all of Missouri and the northern part of Arkansas, resulting in approximately 85,000 square miles becoming Federal-controlled territory.\n\nThis is the second game in the Revolution Games/GMT series of American Civil War games. The first game, Stonewall\u2019s Sword simulates the Battle of Cedar Mountain in 1862.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2016.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1500.0, "minplaytime": 900.0, "maxplaytime": 1500.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 134, 'average': 8.20709, 'bayesaverage': 5.65706, 'stddev': 1.39946, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 554, 'trading': 6, 'wanting': 44, 'wishing': 83, 'numcomments': 86, 'numweights': 10, 'averageweight': 3.3, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6001}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 563}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 6, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}}}", "usersrated": 134.0, "average": 8.20709, "bayesaverage": 5.65706, "stddev": 1.39946, "median": 0.0, "owned": 554.0, "trading": 6.0, "wanting": 44.0, "wishing": 83.0, "numcomments": 86.0, "numweights": 10.0, "averageweight": 3.3, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 6001}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 563}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 13512, "name": "La Bataille d'Albuera: Espagnol", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hoy8uuFeT0znGzBhiCisjw__thumb/img/uekcNP68LtaPemI2ypdp_BcMKbA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic54900.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hoy8uuFeT0znGzBhiCisjw__original/img/ZfsJffVLwPCguiQmXuPhtxqMzW4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic54900.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Albuera (Spain)', 'Country: Spain', 'Series: La Bataille (Clash of Arms Games)']", "categories": "['Napoleonic', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Line of Sight', 'Movement Points', 'Ratio / Combat Results Table', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Monte Mattson', 'Dennis A.

Whilst the game reproduces the situation that faced the historical commanders, the outcome will depend upon the decisions taken by players; it is perfectly possible to change the course of history.\n\nDrive on Damascus uses a peculiar hexagon grid game map in which only the central dot of each hex is depicted.\nBritish forces try to preempt an attack from the Vichy French staged in Syria in 1941.\n\nThis wargame can be run as part of a campaign with O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass and Bloody Keren (which is where the campaign rules are to be found).\n\nPublished 1981, in The Wargamer Magazine issue #15\n\n\nRe-implements:\n\n     Syria, 1941\n\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 day\nHex: 3.2 miles / 5.15 kilometers\nUnits: Company to Battalion\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 23 x 32\" full color mapsheet\nOne single-side printed countersheet (260 1/2\" counters)\nOne 12-page Drive on Damascus rulebook (in magazine)\nPlayer will have to provide one 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: Medium\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1981.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1500.0, "minplaytime": 600.0, "maxplaytime": 1500.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 49, 'average': 6.62449, 'bayesaverage': 5.5264, 'stddev': 1.641, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 221, 'trading': 4, 'wanting': 8, 'wishing': 11, 'numcomments': 49, 'numweights': 8, 'averageweight': 2.75, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 14148}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2672}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 3, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 49.0, "average": 6.62449, "bayesaverage": 5.5264, "stddev": 1.641, "median": 0.0, "owned": 221.0, "trading": 4.0, "wanting": 8.0, "wishing": 11.0, "numcomments": 49.0, "numweights": 8.0, "averageweight": 2.75, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 14148}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2672}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 66906, "name": "Rollerball (future sport)", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UmbiGoJhjGHahex104tP8w__thumb/img/enbTQZJX7xup4uXacEoa3AD4-cM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic667318.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UmbiGoJhjGHahex104tP8w__original/img/VSRfCOLwnZGqZwFIbAR10C3PdtY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic667318.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Players: Two Player Only Games', 'Theme: Sci-Fi Sports']", "categories": "['Print & Play', 'Science Fiction', 'Sports']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['George Duff']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Self-Published)']", "description": "\"The velocity of the ball, the awful physics of the track ... and in the middle of it all, men.

You\u2019ll have to use all the speed of the track to overcome your opponents and force your way through to the goal with that heartless steel ball.\n\nEach player manages his team of skaters, catchers and bikers in an effort to score goals with the ball. Each member of the team is represented by a counter (or figure), with vital information recorded on a separate card. The speed of movement is recorded with a sliding clip on the side of the card, and adjusted turn by turn as the figures race around the track. The player must pull order out of chaos as his team struggles with opponents to control the ball and score goals.\n\nThe movement of figures is affected by the speed and agility of the figure. Complex manuevers, interactions with opposing figures (such as striking and checking) and handling the ball are resolved with dice rolls. As the game progresses, injuries and fatigue will reduce the effectiveness of the team, and play strategy includes decisions about protecting key figures and targeting particular opponents in this full contact sport.\n\nPlaying time is extremely long. This is a simulation game requiring book-keeping and attention to detail. Not for everyone.\n\nGame variants allow modified game constraints such as \"no penalties\" or changes to the time limit.\n\nFree to download from the files section below.\n\nThis is fan work.

The tempo of play is just outstanding, beginning with just a few units in play. Over the next few months both sides rapidly reinforce the theater. The build-up culminates with Rommel\u2019s offensive at Kasserine and tension over the variable entry of Montgomery\u2019s 8th Army. This climax is followed by the slow destruction of Axis forces in North Africa.\n\nThe upgrade of this game involved a handful of important decisions. A straight reprint was out of the question, since the original was designed back when the OCS v2 rulebook was fairly new. In Tunisia II we standardize how the game should be played with the latest series rules, and also have updated it to \u201cfit\u201d better with newer OCS games. So units and rules have been changed to conform to games also set in 1942-43: DAK II, Case Blue, and Sicily II.

Once Axis forces under Rommel had laid siege to Tobruk, they then set about trying to take it. Meanwhile, Commonwealth forces pushed back to the Egyptian border launched several attempts to break into and relieve the fortress. Two of these efforts, BREVITY and BATTLEAXE, lacked the depth needed to accomplish this goal and were utter failures. The third, CRUSADER, was a massive undertaking that successfully opened communications to Tobruk and proved to the British 8th Army that Rommel could be beaten. It also set the stage for Rommel's Gazala offensive in 1942.\n\nBrazen Chariots is the third game in the Battalion Combat Series, which took players by storm with its blockbuster initial release Last Blitzkrieg: Wacht am Rhein, The Battle of the Bulge and follow-up fast playing game Baptism By Fire: The Battle of Kasserine. In Brazen Chariots, the wide-open desert, the limited number of Formations, and numerous shorter scenarios provide players with both a rapid and fun introduction to this highly acclaimed new series.

Last part of the Unintentional Malum Trilogy.\nUnintentional Malum Act 3 contains Adventure Book, Crawl Book, Diagram Book, Plastic Miniatures, new cards plus so much more! It comes with an insert that will allow you to store the entirety of the Unintentional Malum Trilogy in a single box. It will include a detachable token tray, slots for tiles and 5x6 cards, and trenches to keep all your (sleeved) cards stored for all 3 Acts.\n\nTHE STORY CONTINUES\nThese Adventure Expansions continue Unintentional Malum's epic story. These Expansions contain far more than your typical expansion pack. Each Adventure Expansion gives you a massive amount of content that rivals something close to even our original products that they expand. This is to provide the basis for what Middara is all about, story telling, character growth, and continuity.\n\nEach Adventure Expansion gives you at least 40 additional hours of gameplay by extending not only the Base Game they require, but also the surrounding optional ways of playing Middara, including the Crawl Mode.\n\nNEW LOCATIONS\nEach Adventure Pack contains a plethora of beautiful tiles. You'll find airships, exotic floating tombs, deeper levels of the white vaults, and even other worldly locations.\n\nMINIATURES & MONSTERS\nThe story continues as you take your characters into even higher levels of power and face off against even more dangerous and diverse creatures!\nNew weird creatures inhabit the world. Learn their lore, learn their weaknesses, and kill them.\n\nMORE CRAWL MODE OPTIONS\nEach Adventure Expansion contains a set of unique Crawl Mode adventures to play when you don't have time to enjoy the gigantic story. In addition, you'll find that the Crawl Mode's depth has been optionally expanded and it's balance and options more fine tuned for quick and efficient play for those who want that old school dungeon crawler experience.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '363435', 'name': 'Middara: Aboyama, The Rapturasque Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284880', 'name': 'Middara: Casual Nightingale Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284882', 'name': 'Middara: Casual Remi Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284881', 'name': 'Middara: Casual Rook & Suri Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284883', 'name': 'Middara: Casual Zeke Resin Kit'}, {'id': '285034', 'name': 'Middara: Count Dalv Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284884', 'name': 'Middara: Coven Mother Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284814', 'name': 'Middara: Dreamwalker Lymn Resin Kit'}, {'id': '336798', 'name': 'Middara: Faunus, God of the Nymphs Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284885', 'name': 'Middara: Girtiya, The Imprisoned Witch Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284886', 'name': 'Middara: High Priestess Circe Resin Kit'}, {'id': '363439', 'name': 'Middara: Jahzara, Deaspiritus Wishmaker Resin Kit'}, {'id': '363441', 'name': 'Middara: Kickstarter Cross-Promotion Pack'}, {'id': '284952', 'name': 'Middara: KS1 Promo Pack'}, {'id': '284951', 'name': 'Middara: KS2 Promo Pack'}, {'id': '363437', 'name': 'Middara: Leena and Sarrie, Dream-Animators Resin Kit'}, {'id': '363440', 'name': 'Middara: Lupercalia 2021 Pack'}, {'id': '336797', 'name': 'Middara: Lupercalia Pack Resin Kit'}, {'id': '283419', 'name': 'Middara: Pirates of Elenia Vol.1  \u2013 Chasing Legends'}, {'id': '336796', 'name': 'Middara: Psyche, Aphorism of Love Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284724', 'name': 'Middara: Silvia, Dark Mother Cultist Resin Kit'}, {'id': '363436', 'name': 'Middara: Taiga, Hedonistic Muse Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284955', 'name': 'Middara: The Cave Sickle Queen'}, {'id': '284937', 'name': 'Middara: The Collector'}, {'id': '336795', 'name': \"Middara: The Judge's Daughter Resin Kit\"}, {'id': '284716', 'name': 'Middara: The Pit Boss'}, {'id': '284930', 'name': 'Middara: Tomoe Resin Kit'}, {'id': '284823', 'name': 'Middara: Trail of a Princess \u2013 An Opportune Tip'}, {'id': '284953', 'name': 'Middara: Vile Variations Adventure Pack Expansion'}]", "expands": "[{'id': '169427', 'name': 'Middara: Unintentional Malum \u2013 Act 1'}, {'id': '283313', 'name': 'Middara: Unintentional Malum \u2013 Act 2'}]", "yearpublished": 2022.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 2400.0, "minplaytime": 60.0, "maxplaytime": 2400.0, "minage": 15.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 11, 'average': 9.77273, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.391015, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 151, 'trading': 2, 'wanting': 16, 'wishing': 104, 'numcomments': 57, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 11.0, "average": 9.77273, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.391015, "median": 0.0, "owned": 151.0, "trading": 2.0, "wanting": 16.0, "wishing": 104.0, "numcomments": 57.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4+", "num_expansions": 29, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 310829, "name": "Uranus/Saturn: Winter Storm on the Don 1942-43", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Jch-0XTEDPCySL7qMI_SCw__thumb/img/ZxDFOaLKy-jx1qUtDvFS41ORrFE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5448138.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Jch-0XTEDPCySL7qMI_SCw__original/img/1MsDgYXCgIPGu5H9saT3ysbMOq0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5448138.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": "['History: World War II (Eastern Front)', 'Series: Europa']", "categories": "['Expansion for Base-game', 'Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hexagon Grid', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game']", "designers": "['David S.

Their success resulted in the destruction of the elite German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, the disintegration of Germany's Allied Armies and the unhinging of the entire Axis position in the Ukraine.  The Axis, for the first time, were thrown on the strategic defensive and the road to Kursk.  The Germans, for their part, unleashed 'Winter Storm' and the famous Manstein 'backhand blow' which did much to restore the situation.  Within the scope of the EUROPA series of simulations from GDW, Uranus/Saturn attempts to allow gamers to explore the military possibilities open to both sides using components largely available.

One player represents France and her colonial troops. The other player represents the armed force of Viet Minh, the communist/nationalist independence movement of Vietnam. This is a cage fight. There are no victory points, there is no marginal victory and there is no draw. Viet Minh wins by forcing the French troops to surrender. France wins by not surrendering.\n\nMap and scale: The map covers the former village of Dien Bien Phu and surrounding areas. There is a small submap of the French strongpoint \"Isabelle\" further south in the valley. There are several groups of French strongpoints scattered around the map, each one with a female name (all named after the commander - de Castries' - mistresses, according to lore). The map is divided into three divisional sectors (plus a fourth one facing the submap \"Isabelle\"). Each sector has several zones that represent Viet Minh trenches winding from the map edge towards the center of the map. Each hex represents 150 meters and each game turn covers three days. There are 21 turns in the game, but historically, it ended after 19 game turns with a Viet Minh victory. The scale allows stacking of three French units (usually infantry companies) in a hex, but there are no stacking limits for Viet Minh battalions, which creates a chess feel.\n\nThree Viet Minh battalions form a regiment and three regiments become a division and there were almost four full divisions in the valley, as well as a full artillery division off map. There was also an equivalent of another three divisions in a replacement pool outside the valley. The French troops were a colorful array of colonial paras, Vietnamese troops, units from French Algeria and Morocco, and, of course, the French Foreign Legion. Some units are of average quality, some are outright terrible, but some are the very best that could be mustered ... anywhere. A French battalion consisted of four companies and there were 12 battalions together with 11 auxiliary light companies at the start of the siege, as well as 16 artillery and mortar batteries, and three tank platoons. Waiting in Hanoi were another five para battalions together with an expected replacement pool of about 14 companies. In neighboring Laos, there were four battalions ready to march and perhaps save the day at the very end.\n\nFrench supply: This battle took place far out in the wilderness of Vietnam and both sides had to adjust to the limited flow of supplies that could be brought forward, though the air to the French, and through vast forests to the Viet Minh. Supplies, as historically was the case, tend to be a lot less than wished for. There are several supply tracks on the map showing how much ammo, food & bullets, fuel & spares, medicine as well as the amount of truck transport available for the French. Each game turn air transports will bring in a mix of supplies together with replacements and reinforcements. This is done on a chart with a grid where a mix of supply markers are placed together with eventual reinforcements and replacements. Weather will then decide what will arrive and what will abort back to Hanoi. The French player will never know for sure what and how much will arrive and has to take that into account.\n\nViet Minh supply and morale: Viet Minh will receive a more steady flow of ammunition, but not enough to barrage whenever wished. There is a large pool of replacements to use, but although it is large, it is not infinite. If Viet Minh losses are too heavy, then the fact that you can only replace one step per regiment per game turn will be a painful experience. If loses are too heavy for too long, then the pool will dry out. Viet Minh's main concern is troop morale. The battle force starts with excellent morale, but each division's morale will decrease when taking replacements thus diluting the experienced veterans with newly drafted peasants with no combat experience. Morale will rise slightly when resting (not assaulting). But then again, time flies and there is a battle to win. Morale is a very important part of the game and if it falls too low, the troops will be rendered useless.\n\nArtillery: Artillery is another important aspect of the battle. There is bombardment from both sides before assaults commence. You wish to achieve two things with barrage: Losses and to make the target shaken. Targets that are shaken lose abilities to react and support combat, and they become easier to assault. Defending units bring in barrage to make it harder for the attacker to succeed. Viet Minh artillery is off-board and safe from French artillery fire (mainly that they were dug deep into the mountainsides). French artillery and mortar units, on the other hand, exist as units on the board and may fall prey to Viet Minh bombardment. French artillery units that are reduced and/or shaken are not as efficient, and those that are eliminated are obviously out of play. Both sides have a limited amount of ammunition and therefore have to spend it wisely.\n\nCombat: The main effort in the game is, of course, the assaults. Each player will conduct two die-rolls during the course of an assault to determine the outcome. The defender first conducts defensive fire in the hopes of inflicting losses, but also to possibly force the attacker abort the assault. The defender\u2019s first die roll is compared to their strength and will show how well they defend. The defender\u2019s second die-roll (modified from the result of the first die roll), is compared to the assaulting unit's morale and will determine the result of the defensive fire. Providing the assaulting units do not abort, the attacker (who has suffered the effects of the defensive fire) conducts two die rolls. The first one to see how well the assault is conducted, and the second one to see the outcome of the assault. Modifications, such as trenches, terrain, support from other units, etc., adjust the strength of a unit to make it stronger or weaker.\n\nYou will never know for sure what that result will be due to the two die-rolls on each side. Dien Bien Phu \u2013 The Final Gamble, will be as tense and brutal a simulation as was the historical battle that determined the fate of this war as well as shaping the events of things to come.\n\nKim Kanger\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2014.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1440.0, "minplaytime": 360.0, "maxplaytime": 1440.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 253, 'average': 8.6002, 'bayesaverage': 5.80152, 'stddev': 1.22354, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 913, 'trading': 17, 'wanting': 61, 'wishing': 229, 'numcomments': 153, 'numweights': 24, 'averageweight': 3.0833, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3994}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 191}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 10, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 8, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 10, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 2}}}", "usersrated": 253.0, "average": 8.6002, "bayesaverage": 5.80152, "stddev": 1.22354, "median": 0.0, "owned": 913.0, "trading": 17.0, "wanting": 61.0, "wishing": 229.0, "numcomments": 153.0, "numweights": 24.0, "averageweight": 3.0833, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3994}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 191}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 94373, "name": "It Never Snows", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZFzVrbLin_Z_vTzDavWCaA__thumb/img/kTfbBAmgRlfvDX3SM0fK4USOnOg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6180108.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZFzVrbLin_Z_vTzDavWCaA__original/img/NVqPOWlCK8k6vM6U4tF-In5IX_E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6180108.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Arnhem (The Netherlands)', 'Cities: Eindhoven (North Brabant, Netherlands)', 'Cities: Nijmegen (The Netherlands)', 'Country: Netherlands', 'Series: Standard Combat Series (MMP)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Ratio / Combat Results Table', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Dean Essig']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['The Gamers', 'Multi-Man Publishing']", "description": "(from MMP website:)\n\nIt Never Snows is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game covering the pivotal Market Garden offensive in September, 1944.

Each turn is half a day making for a 17 turn campaign game (uniquely playable among Market Garden games).\n  \nThe expansive five map area allows each of the airborne division fights to be geographically isolated and separate, as was the case historically. What this does is that it allows each situation to be gamed as its own little tactical puzzle\u2014making it such that a player might be \u201cwinning\u201d in one region while \u201closing\u201d in another, at the same time. Both players are always \u201cin the game.\u201d\n  \nWhile the Allied player is busy dropping paratroopers, establishing bridgeheads and running a ground offensive to link up with them, the German player must devastate the airborne forces clinging to Arnhem, defend the various river crossings and counterattack to sever the Allied supply lines. Both players are attacking and defending at the same time, every turn.\n  \nFollowing on the heels of Bastogne, It Never Snows uses a tactical model with a minimal amount of rules overhead which shows both set-piece as well as \u201con the fly\u201d attacks and the effects of indirect fires and air support.\n  \nA fantastically detailed OOB shows the insane array of German units being scratched together to defeat the Allied offensive\u2014from displaced sailors to the deaf, from elite armor to barely trained school units, from highly motivated SS to penal units being pushed into battle at gunpoint.

The game requires a game master who controls the game flow. (Due to the nature of the game being active at all times, there needs to be several game masters taking turns.)\n\nThe game is played on a large game board map. Players create characters and move around on the map picking up tokens which allow them to draw cards that represent resources, foes to defeat, missions or certain events. Players form \"clans\" consisting of 2-4 players and roam around the board, pursuing missions, earning experience points, money and points for their clan. Clan points are rewarded for completing missions that advance the game. Clans with high points may build home bases around the board and earn other privilegies.\n\nPlayers can \"log out\" (leave the game) at any time. All cards the player has are saved. The player can come back at any time and re-enter the game by simply reclaiming his cards.\n\nThe game ends when the convention or set time (2-4 days) is at an end, at which point the clan with the most points wins. The game may also end if players manage to fulfil any end-game requirement set up by the game master(s).\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2011.0, "minplayers": 15.0, "maxplayers": 60.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 3000.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 0, 'numcomments': 1, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '7': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '8': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '9': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '10': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '11': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '12': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '13': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '14': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '15': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '16': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '17': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '18': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '19': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '20': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '21': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '22': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '23': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '24': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '25': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '26': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '27': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '28': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '29': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '30': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '30+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 0.0, "numcomments": 1.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "30+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 327547, "name": "The American Professional Football Game, 1920-1949", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZSHlHlVfLRAoEcTOb9_fKw__thumb/img/TeERENy0xm0xV37lge5ljKXuLpk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6530699.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZSHlHlVfLRAoEcTOb9_fKw__original/img/CfLPMvFVAW9NnkYlO-0wNI4D2T4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6530699.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[\"Decades: The 1920's\", 'Sports: American Football / Gridiron']", "categories": "['Educational', 'Print & Play', 'Sports']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['(Self-Published)']", "description": "The American Professional Football Game, 1920-1949, is a print-and-play solitaire educational board game that teaches you the history of professional football from the inception of the American Professional Football Association in 1920 through the National Football League\u2019s 1949 gridiron season.\n\nYour goal is to help professional football survive and thrive by spending Moxie points and attempting to activate inactive teams, stabilize unstable teams, hire and move players and other contributors to teams, lobby for new stadiums, and scout out new independent professional teams.

Major General Truscott's U.S. VI Corps landed along a 45 mile stretch of French Coast with the objective of isolating the major German forces defending the western part of France and linking up with the Normandy forces breaking out of their beachhead. The southern beachhead would be secured in only 2 days and the Americans were well established inland. With scattered and only occasionally strong resistance, the Americans and now landed French advanced north up the Rhone valley along highway N-7 \u2014 heading quickly toward the key rail and road junction at Aix-en-Provence. This was captured on August 19th. At this point, General Truscott activated a provisional force called Task Force Butler. This roughly regimentally sized unit raced ahead of the main force with the objective of capturing the main route of escape for the German Army. The Task Force set up a defensive position in the high ground to the north of Mont\u00e9limar. They were to hold until relieved. The Germans would throw everything they could at Task Force Butler in a race to return to Germany before the larger Allied Formations coming up from the south and east would join Task Force Butler.\n\nIn the end, both sides could claim victory \u2014 the Allies mauled the enemy forces with the Germans suffering 2100 casualties with several thousand soldiers and large amounts of heavy equipment unable to escape.

In less than a month's time it made quick work of Belgium and Holland, shattered the armies of France, and pushed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into the sea at Dunkirk. This twelfth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) game from Multi-Man Publishing and departs from its established norms in using a ground scale of 3 miles per hex and a time scale of two-day turns, and as such is similar to Sicily. The chosen scale lets this lightning campaign unfold a bit more slowly, and gives the densely-packed armies more room to maneuver.\n\nCase Yellow achieved the largest pocket ever to be created in the war, with the largest number of captured soldiers as well. This result is sometimes looked upon by gamers and historians alike as a foregone conclusion, but Manstein's daring strike through the Ardennes was a gamble that might easily have gone awry. Hindsight suggests the fighting could have gone much differently.\n\nA range of historical problems confront the player directing the Allies in this game. His French, Belgian, Dutch, and BEF combat units have not yet mastered the faster pace of action in WWII, and therefore are slow and don't fight at full Action Rating when in Move Mode. The Allies are also forced to adopt the historical Dyle Plan (when not playing the what-if version of the campaign), which leaves the French with inadequate reserves behind the Ardennes and too many of their best forces committed to shielding Antwerp and Brussels. Because history tells us the headlong rush into Belgium was primary cause of the quick Allied defeat, an \"If I Was in Charge...\" version of the campaign is presented to allow both sides to explore some different initial deployments.\n\nA simple set of campaign objectives are presented, with Victory Point awards centered on the following:\n\n\u2022 The French must vigilantly protect Paris, which is the ultimate German objective. Two more cities along the map's south edge, Verdun and Metz, are also worth points (so the French cannot just abandon the Maginot Line).\n\n\u2022 The possible surrender of Holland is triggered by German armor moving adjacent to any of the three Dutch major cities. Surrender chances are modified if the French and BEF are supporting Holland (which is why French 7th Army initially moved north of Antwerp).\n\n\u2022 The possible surrender of Belgium and BEF Evacuation are triggered when the Germans drive a wedge between the Belgian coast and Paris. Surrender chances are modified, however, if the French and BEF are supporting Belgium (another nod toward the historical rationale of the Dyle Plan).\n\n\u2022 The Germans also win points for battering the BEF, so the Allies are encouraged to keep this force intact.\n\nThe game's special rules are judiciously chosen to evoke the full flavor of the campaign. For instance, the Maginot Line is given its historical due, shown as a strong right shield that can unfortunately be outflanked through the Ardennes. Rules for special operations are something new to OCS, and these can capture enemy bridges and forts (but just on 10 May unless playing an optional rule). As mentioned above, the BEF can get isolated or mauled as part of the victory conditions, and if this happens a ragtag assemblage rides to the rescue: RN Destroyers, special Evacuation Ports, elite Irish and Welsh battalions, and even some Spitfires finally appear to provide some top-cover. Mix in the occasional Pause \u2014 an event that tugs sharply on the panzers' leash \u2014 and you've the kind of chrome that make The Blitzkrieg Legend a tremendous tool for historical study and an exciting source of gaming  pleasure.\n\nThe Blitzkrieg Legend is also a game with tremendous replay value. Presented are 7 scenarios and 3 campaigns. The longest is just 13 turns; the largest fits on a standard 4' x 6' table.  Series veterans know the depth of the model can lead to some long and complex turns, but here at last we have an entire campaign that can easily be played to the finish!\n\nScenarios\n\n1. South.  The first 4 turns on the southern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Sedan as well as the crossings of the Meuse further downstream by 6th and 8th Panzer.\n   2. Center. The first 4 turns on the northern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Gembloux Gap as well as the crossings of the Meuse by 5th and 7th Panzer.\n   3. North. The first 4 turns on Map C. Covers the air landings and surrender of Holland.\n   4. Mini-Campaign. Links the first three scenarios into a short campaign using two maps.\n   5. Sedan. Lasts just 2 turns and uses just a small portion of Map B. Covers the French counterattack and German breakout.\n   6. Arras. Lasts just 1 player turn. A teaching scenario covering the Allied counterattack.\n   7. Dynamo. Lasts 8 turns. Plays like a campaign game, using just Map A to cover the important events during the last half of the campaign.\n\nCampaigns\n\n1. \"No Holland\" Version. Doesn't include the fighting in Holland, which is \"automatic\" and not under player control. Uses two maps, the full 13 turns.\n   2. \"With Holland\" Version. Uses all three maps, the full 13 turns.\n   3. \"If I Was in Charge...\"  Several variations on either of the two campaigns are offered.\n\nComponents:\n\n\n     OCS Series Rulebook\n     TBL Game Specific Rulebook\n     Two Charts and Tables Booklets\n     Full Color Game Map (two 22x34, one 28x15)\n     1,960 Counters (7 counter sheets)\n     One 8.5x11 Play Aid\n     10 Scenarios (3 of them are Campaign Scenarios)\n     Box and Dice\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2012.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 2880.0, "minplaytime": 2880.0, "maxplaytime": 2880.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 222, 'average': 8.0491, 'bayesaverage': 5.74578, 'stddev': 1.52551, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 981, 'trading': 18, 'wanting': 50, 'wishing': 137, 'numcomments': 109, 'numweights': 27, 'averageweight': 3.8889, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4590}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 325}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 5, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 222.0, "average": 8.0491, "bayesaverage": 5.74578, "stddev": 1.52551, "median": 0.0, "owned": 981.0, "trading": 18.0, "wanting": 50.0, "wishing": 137.0, "numcomments": 109.0, "numweights": 27.0, "averageweight": 3.8889, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4590}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 325}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 3564, "name": "Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game", "alternative_names": "['Terrible Swift Sword: The Three Days of Gettysburg']", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FDAEWwdn0HCgw4uyFaNEpw__thumb/img/JIqpZtmgNRNd9H-4XeywYwtJCgg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4258061.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FDAEWwdn0HCgw4uyFaNEpw__original/img/hbY-yZwg-xBosItHnnasYcc_ATg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4258061.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: USA', 'History: Battle of Gettysburg', 'Series: Great Battles of the American Civil War (Richard H.

Charlie Kibler\u2019s groundbreaking design covered the battle for Stalingrad around the \u201cKrasny Barrikady\u201d (or Red Barricades) ordnance factory on two historically accurate maps. Red Barricades offered a new ASL experience, introducing the concept of Campaign Games (CGs), multi-scenario battles spread over several days, alongside traditional scenarios depicting discrete historical actions. Three CGs and seven standalone scenarios covered the epic struggle for the heart of Stalin\u2019s city. The CGs presented a special challenge, as players not only directed their forces in action, but also built and customized their orders of battle, agonizing over how best to spend their precious resources to achieve overall victory in a grueling campaign. Charlie now brings us RED OCTOBER. This follow-on HASL adds two new maps, expanding the playing area covered in Red Barricades to include the \u201cKrasny Oktyabr\u201d (or Red October) factory complex. RED OCTOBER features three CGs and seven scenarios. Honed under the playtest guidance of Gary Fortenberry, Red October has now been submitted to MMP.\n\nThe two modules are combined into one package: Red Factories. The source files for Red Barricades are no longer available, so Charlie will take this opportunity to paint all four maps in a consistent style to assure they match. This also allows us to update the original Red Barricades material, taking into account accumulated clarifications and errata. Over the years a great deal of follow-on material has been released for Red Barricades, including a fourth campaign game. We are consolidating this material to create an expanded version of Red Barricades as part of the new release.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[{'id': '243', 'name': 'Advanced Squad Leader'}]", "yearpublished": 2019.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 3600.0, "minplaytime": 180.0, "maxplaytime": 3600.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 99, 'average': 9.26061, 'bayesaverage': 5.65525, 'stddev': 0.883498, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 712, 'trading': 8, 'wanting': 8, 'wishing': 38, 'numcomments': 53, 'numweights': 5, 'averageweight': 5.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 1, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 99.0, "average": 9.26061, "bayesaverage": 5.65525, "stddev": 0.883498, "median": 0.0, "owned": 712.0, "trading": 8.0, "wanting": 8.0, "wishing": 38.0, "numcomments": 53.0, "numweights": 5.0, "averageweight": 5.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": "Advanced Squad Leader", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 209502, "name": "Atlanta Is Ours", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YVIm78-DN3tarYwPC2_cyw__thumb/img/r9K0PbmYdx0eEXJ0uRlHHAk7nDA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3958365.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YVIm78-DN3tarYwPC2_cyw__original/img/ACyMfJYTFiTjMDCUWfFg83cP9MI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3958365.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Atlanta (Georgia, USA)', 'States: Georgia', 'Series: Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (Avalon Hill/MMP)']", "categories": "['American Civil War', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Ed Beach', 'Mike Belles', 'Chris Withers']", "artists": "['Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi', 'Charles Kibler']", "publishers": "['Multi-Man Publishing']", "description": "Atlanta Is Ours is a game in the award-winning Series: Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (Avalon Hill/MMP) (GCACW) series.

The Advanced Game rules are also standardized so players will be able to move quickly from one campaign to the other.\n\nAtlanta Is Ours includes fourteen Basic Game scenarios and five Advanced Game campaigns, all extensively playtested:\n\nBasic Game Scenarios\n\n    The Opportunity of a Lifetime (Snake Creek Gap/Resaca (5/9/1864, 1 turn, small forces): Beginner\u2019s scenario, great for learning how to play.\n    The Gap Is Blocked (5/8-5/10/1864, 3 turns): Hypothetical scenario, what could have happened if Sherman had not sent McPherson to Snake Creek Gap and instead attacked or tried to outflank other points in the Confederate defenses.\n    Battle of Resaca (5/14/1864; 1 turn): Sherman's entire army reinforces McPherson's corps outside Resaca, and attacks Johnston's army in Resaca, which has just arrived from its positions around Dalton.\n    From the Oostanaula to the Etowah (5/17-5/23/1864, 7 turns): Sweeping maneuver from one river to the other, with the aborted battle of Cassville near the end of the scenario. Includes special random events and optional limited intelligence.\n    Advance and Retreat (5/19-5/22/1864; 4 turns): Johnston's army attempts to attack a portion of Sherman's army while Sherman is advancing on a wide front. Hood aborts the attack as it is developing and falls back into a defensive line near Cassville.\n    The Hell Hole (5/25-5/28/1864; 4 turns): Sherman moves off the rail line to the west in an attempt to flank Johnston, but is stopped after several days of battle. This scenario encompasses the battles of Dallas, New Hope Church, and Pickett's Mill.\n    Kennesaw Mountain (6-22-6/27; 6 turns): This scenario covers the battles of Kolb\u2019s Farm and Kennesaw Mountain.\n    Crossing the Chattahoochee (7/3-7/8/1864; 6 turns): Johnston retreats from Kennesaw Mountain and then Sherman breaches Johnston's line covering the bridges and fords of the Chattahoochee River.\n    Battle of Atlanta (7/20-7/22/1864; 3 turns): Hood (now in command of the CSA army) attacks portions of Sherman's army twice, at Peachtree Creek and Bald Hill, but is beaten back with heavy losses both times.\n    Ezra Church (7/28/1864; 1 turn; half armies): Hood sends two corps to block Howard (now commanding the Army of the Tennessee), who is attempting to move around Atlanta from the west; they stop Howard, but incur heavy casualties in their attacks.\n    Wheeler's Raid (8/10-8/15; 6 turns; solitaire cavalry scenario): Wheeler moves north to disrupt the Union supply line around Dalton; -Wheeler does minimal damage before being forced to retreat.\n    Kilpatrick's Raid (8/18-8/22/1864; 5 turns, cavalry scenario): Kilpatrick takes the Union cavalry south around Atlanta to Lovejoy's Station, but he does minimal damage and returns to Union lines.\n    Marching On Tara (8/28 - 9/1/1864; 5 turns): Sherman moves around the west flank of the Confederates and marches to the RR stations supplying Atlanta from the west and the south.

Fans of Axis Empires: Totaler Krieg and Axis Empires: Dai Senso will want to get this \u2013 it\u2019s a big, big package designed to add even more enjoyment to our popular series of World War II grand strategy games. The AE Expansion Kit includes three parts. First, there\u2019s Schiffskrieg, the air-and-naval expansion that provides additional detail for players who want more from the game beyond its abstract support units. Now players must base their air assets and ships (down to the cruiser level) on the map and move them to respond to threats. Air-naval combat, commerce raiding, anti-submarine warfare and naval construction are all accounted for while preserving that Krieg design elegance you know and love.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s Dice of Decision II, a much-expanded update to the Random Campaign Generator featured in Totaler Krieg! As before, you\u2019ll be able to create new, very different Second World Wars based on alt-history paths from the Great War and the 1920s and \u201830s: What if the Tsar still ruled Russia? What if Germany had won the war in 1917? What if there hadn\u2019t been a Great Depression? New for DoD II is everything related to Asia and the Pacific \u2013 now you\u2019ll be able to explore alternate Pacific Wars: What if there were no Washington Naval Treaty? What if Japan\u2019s 1931 involvement in Manchuria had unfolded differently? What if Gandhi had gained independence for India? Naturally, your alt-hist Europe and Pacific games will still link to tell a completely original Global War story.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the TK & DS Upgrade: everything you need to update your existing Axis Empires games to true \u201csecond edition\u201d status without requiring you to buy whole new copies. The Upgrade incorporates six years of additional design, development and research since the 2011 publication of TK and DS. It also includes new optional rules and scenarios that had to be cut from those games for space reasons. Now you can play out that East vs. West \u201cSeparate Peace\u201d scenarios and spring unexpected surprises on your opponents with \u201cFortunes of War\u201d cards! Ownership of Axis Empires: Totaler Krieg or Axis Empires: Dai Senso required. Four maps; 1,120 small counters; 350 cards. Est.

Holding fortified positions and bolstered by the crack Philippine Scouts, the Allied forces would hold for months against the well equipped and trained Japanese invaders.\n\nBataan! is a two-player game, recreating the battle for the peninsula. Vance von Borries has drawn from his game design experience to create a game engine capable of portraying the tense jungle-fighting which took place on Bataan. While the system is based on a previous success, the changes needed to simulate the fighting on Bataan make this a unique gaming experience.\n\nJapanese forces will move quickly to out-flank and pry the US/Filipino units from their fortifications. Yet the Americans can successfully launch attacks out of these strong points, particularly when the crack Philippine Scouts are in the lead. From time to time a player may lead with his armor and this was the one battle of the war where the lowly US Stuart tank was the superior tank!\n\nA chit-pull system is used to randomly determine activations for the various formations on each side. In general, formation size is based on a division. Each formation activates individually for movement and combat. Players alternate activations based on the random chit-pull until all formations have played. Most Japanese formations receive two activations per turn, thereby demonstrating their combat capabilities, preparedness and motivation in taking an offensive role. Individual unit counters represent battalions or half battalions, and include efficiency ratings for combat comparisons and other functions.\n\nBataan! features five scenarios. The three early scenarios, which include a learning scenario, all play to a conclusion in one sitting. They feature a surprising amount of movement for a mostly jungle warfare game and rely on sound military tactics. Only the fourth scenario, the last battle, is a true set-piece action. The Japanese planned it that way and yet even the outcome of that battle was not pre-ordained. All scenarios are tied together by a campaign scenario where both players contend with supply and disease to field the best force possible for the final offensive.\n\nComponents:\n\n     1 map \u2013 22\u201d x 34\u201d - [scale of 1.2 km to the hex] \n        2 full sheets of 0.6\u201d counters [or 408 5/8 inch counters]\n        11 full-color set-up and player aid cards\n        1 rules booklet [with historical notes] \n        1 10-sided dice\n        1 full color box and lid set\n\n\nDesigner: Vance von Borries\nDeveloper: Mark Guttag\nArtist: Tim Schleif\n\n\n(BGG user description:)\n\nBataan! is a two-player operational level game of this WW II Pacific theater campaign, January through April 1942. It presents a fascinating contest of two mismatched armies on a subject our hobby has not gamed often. The US/Filipino defense, embattled, isolated and led initially by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, for three months held off a numerically inferior but well-equipped and very aggressive Japanese force led by General Masaharu Homma. While the US and Filipino forces can be said to have won most of the first contests: the Abucay Line, the Battle of the Points and the Battle of the Pockets, it would be the final contest that decided the issue. Only because of continued complete isolation would the US lose that final battle in April 1942. And yet it was that heroic defense of sublime courage that helped motivate the US to endure the reverses of the war and persevere to a complete victory. It was \"Why We Fight.\"\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2010.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 67, 'average': 7.64907, 'bayesaverage': 5.56457, 'stddev': 1.22724, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 397, 'trading': 14, 'wanting': 21, 'wishing': 63, 'numcomments': 43, 'numweights': 16, 'averageweight': 3.875, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 9659}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1507}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 5, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}}}", "usersrated": 67.0, "average": 7.64907, "bayesaverage": 5.56457, "stddev": 1.22724, "median": 0.0, "owned": 397.0, "trading": 14.0, "wanting": 21.0, "wishing": 63.0, "numcomments": 43.0, "numweights": 16.0, "averageweight": 3.875, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 9659}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1507}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 368885, "name": "Cold Waves: The Atlantic & North Sea 1739-1748", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eRoVRmZr9a6vdzGSzVDnQA__thumb/img/x3_u0RHeCwUOlIXAm6tGRak_tD4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7016867.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eRoVRmZr9a6vdzGSzVDnQA__original/img/e7wUt-JplPut12XG8L8ufFALi2M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7016867.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['History: War of the Austrian Succession', 'Players: Wargames with Rules Supporting Only Two Players', 'Region: North Sea', 'Series: Lace Wars (Red Sash)', 'Series: Sea Lords (Red Sash Games)']", "categories": "['Age of Reason', 'Nautical', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Simulation']", "designers": "['Ian Weir']", "artists": "['Ian Weir']", "publishers": "['Red Sash Games']", "description": "Cold Waves is the final game of a set covering the War of the Austrian Succession at sea (plus the concurrent War of Jenkin's Ear). Though relatively unknown, these conflicts, raging from 1739-1748, comprised the first \"world war\". The primary naval actions took place in three theatres: the English Channel and Bay of Biscay, the Caribbean, and the western Mediterranean. Forces also clashed in India, along America's eastern seaboard, and in the Pacific. Cold Waves examines the European Atlantic coasts, the Channel, and the North Sea, where tedious blockade duty and convoy hunting was laced with the ever present fear of amphibious invasion \u2013 something both sides tried more than once.\n\nCold Waves is a two player strategy game. You command either the British or Bourbon (French and Spanish) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points). You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organising your 'sail' (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at battle readiness is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear \u2013 a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters actually in play on the map is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players.\n\nEvery ship that appeared in the theatre is accounted for, as is every leader of note. (Although by the basic rules ships are generic 'SPs', players can use the OOBs to add detail and even fight battles using their favourite tactical system.) Squadrons are rated for movement and the number of sail they can contain. Specially named squadrons represent the great ships, like the 112-gun Real Felipe, which successfully beat off a simultaneous attack by three British ships of the line. Other counters represent special assets, like fireships, frigates, and galleys. These can be 'played' (like cards) to conduct special tasks such as search and shore bombardment. Leaders are ranked, and rated for skill and personality.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2016.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 3000.0, "minplaytime": 180.0, "maxplaytime": 3000.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 0, 'average': 0.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 1, 'wishing': 2, 'numcomments': 0, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 1.0, "wishing": 2.0, "numcomments": 0.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2+", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 225609, "name": "Smolensk: Barbarossa Derailed", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GnQ80hFIMP8xLUEtbuWVmg__thumb/img/Ov0BPo_mmLorIgMBpM66EugBm0U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4086697.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GnQ80hFIMP8xLUEtbuWVmg__original/img/arPWfnaokaVBG88MXi7A7VGJQaw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4086697.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Belarus', 'Country: Russia', 'History: World War II (Eastern Front)', 'Series: Operational Combat Series (MMP)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['Dean Essig', 'Hans Kishel', 'John Kisner']", "artists": "['Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi', 'Dean Essig']", "publishers": "['Multi-Man Publishing']", "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nSmolensk: Barbarossa Derailed is the latest release in the Operational Combat Series (OCS), covering the campaign along the Moscow highway in the summer of 1941. These actions set the stage for the Wehrmacht\u2019s autumn drive on the Soviet capital, and many historians believe the bitter fighting here ultimately doomed the Axis to failure in Russia.\n\nThe game begins on 8 July with Barbarossa still in high gear. In August, the advance stalls as Hitler diverts most of the panzers from the map to forces around Leningrad and Kiev. Soviet counteroffensives will push Army Group Center close to the breaking point by game\u2019s end on 8 September. The asymmetry of the two armies will be familiar to veterans of past OCS campaigns, especially Guderian\u2019s Blitzkrieg II. There is the expected qualitative difference in typical Action Ratings, along with stark contrasts in logistical capabilities and replacement rates. There also some unique twists in the situation, including:\n\n\n     Three of the panzer divisions are getting their first taste of combat, so their Action Ratings are reduced.\n     The rivalry between Heinz Guderian and Hermann Hoth makes it difficult for these generals to coordinate their panzer armies, and might prevent the ring from closing around Smolensk.\n     Soviet tank divisions are shown for the first time. They pack a wallop, but their quality leaves a lot to be desired.\n     The Soviet 1st Motorized Division is presented as a somewhat elite multi-unit formation that includes some heavy KV-1s and T-34s.\n     The contributions of small militia, tank, and anti-tank units are reflected by the Soviet Alarm Pool.\n     Other chrome accounts for \u2018tree bark soup\u2019 (used by cut-off units), planes diverted to terror-bomb Moscow, and special markers for artillery ammo & katyusha effects.\n\n\nSmolensk is a small and fairly simple entry in the series, with special rules kept to a minimum. We think players will enjoy the fact both sides must attack and defend.

Your instructions are to carry the war to the enemy in the manner you best see fit, but not so as to endanger either the realm or the royal purse. If you fail, there will be... displeasure. Your duties commence at once. Do not return without victory.\n\nIn 1741, while the rest of Europe involved itself in yet another interminable succession war, Sweden and Russia squared off in yet another of their own squabbles for dominance in the Baltic. The Russian monarchy was unstable, and a cabal of Swedish hawks - whose party was known as the Hats - sought to replace the current empress with one friendly to Sweden. France, Sweden's paymaster, encouraged the plan, hoping to distract Russia from affairs in Europe. The Swedes would claim some of the territory taken from them during the Great Northern War. Either the new empress would grant them the land out of gratitude for their aid, or their armies would simply take it. It was a daring plan, and one beyond Sweden's means. And yet it came very close to success. The coup went off as planned, but the Russian Army, led by one of Europe's best marshals - Peter Lacy of County Clare - struck first, upsetting the Swedish timetable. Instead of the Swedish army managing the palace coup from the Winter Palace, it was floundering in the snows of Karelia when the new regime took power. Now, unable to acquire the territory they desired through negotiations, the Hats foolishly challenged the full might of Russia to a trial of arms...\n\nThe Russo-Swedish War of 1741-1743, otherwise called the Hats' War or the War of the Hats, has to be the most obscure conflict Red Sash Games has tackled so far. Measured by the butcher's bill, it was hardly a minor one, however, with something like 50,000 casualties. Historically, it was a fiasco for the Swedes, but partly this was due to bad luck - an epidemic ravaged their fleet - and partly due to internal politics. Surely, as the Swedish generalissimo, YOU can do better? If you choose to play the Russians instead, you will have many, many troops, and excellent commanders to lead them, but you will be faced by deadlines as the diplomats are already discussing peace terms. Will you be able to make a name for yourself before they pull the curtain down?\n\nThe Game\n\nALW is a two-player operational study of the War of the Hats, fought between the Swedes and the Russians in the years 1741-1743. Included in the game is a set of the latest basic rules, charts, and tables (version 3.75) for the Lace Wars system.\n\nA few key concepts in this system include Operations Points, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. Operations Points are accumulated during periods of inactivity, in order to be spent during the course of active campaigning. If a player is unable or unwilling to spend OPs, his forces suffer attrition instead. The further forces are from their base of operations, the more severe the penalties will be. Whoever has the most OPs also has the initiative.\n\nThe heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players alternate moving their formations, laying siege to fortresses and engaging in battle with the enemy field forces. The players have a degree of flexibility in what they do with their forces, but they are constrained by the Campaign Plan or plans that they choose. These dictate what objectives (usually fortresses) must be taken. A successfully completed plan will garner Prestige for a player. At the end of the game, the player with the highest prestige wins. In addition, bonuses can be won for victory in battle, and these may be used to buy rewards that improve a player's chances, or be used as influence.\n\nThe combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.\n\n\nSommar Skr\u00e5la - The Baltic, 1741-1743\n\nSommar Skr\u00e5la is the second of a set of games covering the Age of Sail at an Operational level. While the War of the Austrian Succession raged elsewhere in Europe, and around the globe, in the Baltic Sweden and Russia faced off in the little known War of the Hats. At one level, the war had been engineered by France to keep Russia from helping Austria, but at another level, it was a war to reclaim Sweden's lost empire. The war was poorly managed by Sweden, and for a number of reasons they suffered a catastrophe of the first water \u2013 especially, the war was begun to help a Russian princess overthrow the current dynasty (in return for territorial concessions that were not forthcoming); a war with such an object was sure to be a confused affair.\n\nSommar Skr\u00e5la also examines the possibility of Danish intervention. In reality, the Danish Prince Royal was an heir-presumptive candidate for the Swedish crown (the Swedes having an elective monarchy), and the Danish King assembled men and ships to help Sweden defend this choice against Russia. But Sweden, in the end chose a candidate favored by Russia (as the price of peace) and the Danes very nearly went to war against Sweden instead.\n\nThe Game\n\nSommar Skr\u00e5la is a two player strategy game. You command either the Swedish or Muscovite (Russian) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points), and may even have an impact on the land campaign. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organizing your \"sail\" (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at \"battle readiness\" is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear \u2013 a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters in play is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players. A special campaign scenario allows the players to link Sommar Skr\u00e5la with its companion Lace Wars game \u2013 A Lesser Wrath.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2013.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 1200.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 7, 'average': 8.14286, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.638877, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 36, 'trading': 1, 'wanting': 8, 'wishing': 11, 'numcomments': 5, 'numweights': 4, 'averageweight': 4.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 2, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 7.0, "average": 8.14286, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.638877, "median": 0.0, "owned": 36.0, "trading": 1.0, "wanting": 8.0, "wishing": 11.0, "numcomments": 5.0, "numweights": 4.0, "averageweight": 4.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 360480, "name": "Hunt a Killer: Empty Faces \u2013 The Woods", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": null, "image": null, "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Category: Escape Room Games', 'Series: Hunt a Killer', 'Theme: Mystery / Crime', 'Theme: Witches']", "categories": "['Deduction', 'Murder/Mystery', 'Puzzle']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Deduction', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Storytelling', 'Team-Based Game']", "designers": "[]", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['Hunt A Killer']", "description": "We know you can solve a murder, but what happens when evil forces are at play?

It uses playing pieces that represent the actual military units that participated in this campaign. Each player represents the commander of the Axis or Allied forces. The individual ground units represent battalions of approximately 700 soldiers (50-60 tanks in an armored battalion, 12-24 guns in an artillery battalion), or companies of about 200 soldiers (15-20 tanks or armored cars in an armored company, 4-12 guns in an artillery battery). Each hex represents 2 kilometers or 1.25 miles. Each turn is a third of a day.\n\nOperation Crusader is a two-player game, with team play possible for the full campaign game. \nOne player assumes the role of the Axis and the other player assumes the role of the Allies. \nEach player moves his units and executes attacks on enemy units in turn, attempting to fulfill the game\u2019s Victory Conditions. \nTo move from one space to another, each unit expends a portion of its Movement Allowance. \nCombat is resolved through Battles by \"firing\" at opposing units and then determining the outcome of any hits scored. A die is used to resolve combat.\n\nThe classic monster game returns with a newly-streamlined game system throughout (no more pre-plotting movement!). This new edition emphasizes playability while capturing the flavor of the original game. The game adds smaller scenarios (6 total), each covering a shorter and smaller part of the historic battle, and a full campaign game which allows players to experience the full sweep of Operation Crusader.

Drang Nach Osten! is a complete game of the largest invasion in history, but may be incorporated into the larger series of game/simulations collectively titled Europa. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942.  Unentschieden (Europa II) continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire war in the East, 1941-45.\n\nGame Components:\n\n\n    Five 21 x 27\" mapsheets (numbered Europa 1 through 5).\n    One set of eight unit countersheets (for a total of 1792 counters) consisting of:\n    Two Europa sheet 1\n    One Europa sheet 2\n    Three Europa sheet 3\n    One Europa sheet 4\n    One Europa sheet 5 (half-sheet)\n    One rules folder and cover.\n    One set of charts and tables consisting of:\n        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle\n        One Soviet Order of Appearance\n        One Soviet Units Appearing Chart\n        One German Initial Order of Battle\n        One German Order of Appearance\n        One German Units Appearing Chart\n        Two Combat Results Tables\n        One Unit Identification Chart\n        One Time Record Chart\n        One Terrain Effects on Combat Chart\n    \n\n\nNotes:\n\nEach hex is 16 miles, each turn is two weeks. Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. There is a fair amount of unit specialisation, although at 20 pages the rules are far less intimidating by today's standards than when they first appeared over thirty years ago. Drang Nach Osten! lasts for 19 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Mar II 42), so allowing for the initial set up 20 sessions of several hours is a realistic playing time.\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '15593', 'name': 'Unentschieden'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1973.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 4.0, "playingtime": 12000.0, "minplaytime": 12000.0, "maxplaytime": 12000.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 87, 'average': 6.85517, 'bayesaverage': 5.5509, 'stddev': 1.87891, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 206, 'trading': 10, 'wanting': 15, 'wishing': 30, 'numcomments': 60, 'numweights': 11, 'averageweight': 4.1818, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10732}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1925}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 1}, '2': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4+': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 87.0, "average": 6.85517, "bayesaverage": 5.5509, "stddev": 1.87891, "median": 0.0, "owned": 206.0, "trading": 10.0, "wanting": 15.0, "wishing": 30.0, "numcomments": 60.0, "numweights": 11.0, "averageweight": 4.1818, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 10732}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1925}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4+", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 279523, "name": "Army of Flanders", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/G61YLOQgZ9zKRAoHan2UFA__thumb/img/dIkkRjwKdJ5LtXAAiFyohguW_1w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5005554.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/G61YLOQgZ9zKRAoHan2UFA__original/img/rd2uaaTtKgq6ZxtibpfkksG8DkA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5005554.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['History: Nine Years War', 'Series: Lace Wars (Red Sash)']", "categories": "['Age of Reason', 'Pike and Shot', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']", "designers": "['Ian Weir']", "artists": "['Ian Weir']", "publishers": "['Red Sash Games']", "description": "Army of Flanders is the thirteenth volume in Red Sash Games\u2019 Lace Wars series. This game is the third in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or\nthe Nine Years War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV. As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand\nFrance\u2019s borders. That was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson\non the throne of Spain. Despite the King\u2019s ultimate aim, that was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis\u2019 war of middle age \u2013 a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men.\n\nIn Army of Flanders, you will have a chance to change history \u2013 and even if you cannot, perhaps you can win enough glory to\nwrite your name in the history books. Flanders is the source of Gloire, and the graveyard of reputations.\n\nAs the French, will you pursue an offensive or a defensive strategy? The French Army is state-of-the-art. You have more artillery, the latest equipment (bayonets instead of pikes), and acess to an administrative machine capable of supporting nearly 500,000 men. But you are under the eye of Versailles, only a couple of day\u2019s ride from the front. You are merely an extension of the King\u2019s will. If his reputation needs patching up, expect to be ordered to lay siege to some massive fortress. At least you will have the resources. But, if the King decides to pursue diplomacy, you will have to secure and \u2018rationalise\u2019 the frontier. If you fail, you will lose the respect of the Sun King and the Court ladies. IF you disobey\u2026 it does not bear thinking about.\n\nAs the Allied commander you lead a motley collection of troops: Dutch, British, Spanish, German, Huguenot, and even the not\ninconsiderable army of Li\u00e8ge. The Germans want to pursue a Rhine strategy. The Spanish want to hunker down and let the Dutch\ndo all the fighting. The British Isles are still being subjugated by the Prince of Orange, though much of the populace supports him.In the early years it will be enough to hold the line. Later, hopefully, the enemy will run out of steam and you can pay him back in his own coin!\n\nLike the other games in the series, Army of Flanders focuses on the operational art rather than tactics or grand strategy. You are the theatre commander, subject to dictates from on high and only partially able to guide the action. Your main goal is to acquire Prestige. Your playing pieces represent battalions and regiments, which you must deploy wisely, deciding how strong to make your garrisons, and how many units to group into mobile formations for attack or defence. These formations are commanded by Leaders, rated for their skill and their temperament (and their political pull), and assisted by Auxiliaries. These last are specialists such as grenadiers and pioneers. Once you are organised, be sure you pick the right time to fight. You have a large army, but it is not infinite! The combat system has a tactical feel, addressing the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Sieges depend on good planning. Screen your besieging army with another to keep the enemy at bay and make sure you have lots of siege guns and sappers. Supply is critical.

It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of \"pulses\" and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).\n\nThe key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.\n\n\n     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.\n\n\n\n     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of \"discretionary\" CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.\n\n\n\n     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.\n\n\n\n     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)\n\n\nThe game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.\n\nPlayers gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.\n\nFor those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.\n\nThe Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail.

The last time was 1979 when the PRC invaded Vietnam in response to the latter's invasion and occupation of Cambodia. That war lasted about four weeks before China withdrew, having declared its mission accomplished. \n Now, the old foes are at it once again. Sparring over the resource rich areas of the South China Sea, both sides have been slowly edging toward the precipice of war. That day has now come.\n\nNext War: Vietnam is the fifth game in the Next War Series. This game returns the action to Asia and the powderkeg surrounding the South China Sea. This time the Chinese don't intend a limited, punitive expedition; they intend to squash the burgeoning threat from their southern border once and for all and prove, through force of arms, that the South China Sea is theirs. Building on the naval rules showcased Next War: Taiwan, players will have a chance to fight over the Spratly and Paracel Islands once again, as well as the mountainous jungle of North Vietnam. \n If the U.S. gets involved, it might finally land troops in Haiphong Harbor and march on Hanoi, albeit as a relief force and an ally to its former enemy. The question is what will the rest of the region do? Will they join a side or stay neutral?\n Next War: Vietnam will also allow players to play a combined game with Next War:Taiwan, and, with the rules in the latter game, adding on NextWar: Korea as well for what would amount to the Pacific Front of World War III. \n Ownership of any previous Next War Series will NOT be required to play Next War: Vietnam.\n\nUnits: \n Next War: Vietnam primarily represents divisions and brigades of the armies of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV). All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency. The Vietnamese People's Self Defense Force is represented both by units and special rules. \n Air units represent the fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants. They are rated for All-Weather Capabilities, range, average pilot skill and training, and their capabilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions. \n Naval units represent an abstraction of groups of ships (task forces) and allow players to conduct amphibious invasions, naval combat, naval gunfire support, and more. \n Maps and Terrain \n The game\u2019s map represents the area in and around the northern border of Vietnam at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from just west of Dien Bien Phu, Vietnam to just east of Nanning, China and just north of the PRC-SRV border to a few miles south of Thanh Hoa, Vietnam. \n The Spratlys, Paracels, and other sea areas are represented by a Strategic Display incorporating Land Areas and At Sea Boxes similar to the one in Next War: Taiwan. \n Game System \n A game turn is composed of:\n\nWeather Determination wherein bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations. \nInitiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.\nSpecial Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. \nStrike Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes. \nOne or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns. \nArrival of Reinforcements and Replacements \nVictory Determination\n\nCombat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.\n\nScenarios\n\nThere are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives, while at least one will be a campaign game encompassing the entire map. Similarly to previous games in the series, the Advanced Game scenarios will be divided into various starting points representing different levels of build-up before the game begins.\n\nNext War: Vietnam puts you in command of the potential conflict. Can you, as the Chinese player, enforce your will on Vietnam and achieve your goals in the South China Sea, shaping your position in world affairs? Or will you, as the Vietnamese player, once again successfully defend against your larger northern neighbor?\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '313074', 'name': 'Next War: Supplement #3'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2020.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 96, 'average': 8.45521, 'bayesaverage': 5.61794, 'stddev': 0.949766, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 680, 'trading': 6, 'wanting': 17, 'wishing': 95, 'numcomments': 43, 'numweights': 10, 'averageweight': 4.2, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 7056}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 809}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 96.0, "average": 8.45521, "bayesaverage": 5.61794, "stddev": 0.949766, "median": 0.0, "owned": 680.0, "trading": 6.0, "wanting": 17.0, "wishing": 95.0, "numcomments": 43.0, "numweights": 10.0, "averageweight": 4.2, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 7056}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 809}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 263293, "name": "Imperium Romanum", "alternative_names": "[\"Al Nofi's Imperium Romanum: The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire\"]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0Es0UWwNo09U8NC50UkG4g__thumb/img/wIKF5hwaClAj4HgQdb226VOoZyQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4367129.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0Es0UWwNo09U8NC50UkG4g__original/img/fFS9WZ0LOI1GI45u2kyJNNtyR9E=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4367129.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Ancient: Rome', 'Components: Map (Continental / National scale)', 'Country: Greece', 'History: Byzantium', 'Players: Games with Solitaire Rules', 'Players: Wargames with Solitaire Rules', 'Region: Mediterranean Sea']", "categories": "['Ancient', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "['Imperium Romanum II']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Simulation', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Albert A.

Beyond, June 6, 1944 through May 19, 1945\n\nD-Day, the largest amphibious invasion in history, opened the final chapter of the war in Europe with the landings on four Normandy beaches.  For almost a year, General Eisenhower balanced Allied resources and clashing subordinates as he slowly drove back Field Marshal Karl von Rundstedt\u2019s forces, who struggled with Hitler to command his theater forces. In late January 1945 the Rhine was breached and the end of the Third Reich drew nearer.\n\nD-Day and Beyond is a tense, two-player operational board game covering the European theater from the French Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts to the dense German forests, the Siegfried line, and the Rhine River.  The Allied player faces the tough decision about where and when to land troops, what scarce air and naval resources to employ on offense or defense, and struggles to keep a coherent supply line to his forward troops.  The German player has to throw the landing(s) off the beach, if able, and failing that, fight a retrograde war that requires balancing holding key terrain, slowing the Allied advance, and preserving units.  Additional rules showcase the Resistance, rail movement, airborne operations, carpet bombing, the release of German reserves, and the infamous Wacht Am Rhein offensive known as Autumn Mist.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2020.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 3.0, "playingtime": 1500.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 1500.0, "minage": 10.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 10, 'average': 7.25, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.75, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 39, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 7, 'wishing': 14, 'numcomments': 2, 'numweights': 5, 'averageweight': 2.4, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 4, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 10.0, "average": 7.25, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.75, "median": 0.0, "owned": 39.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 7.0, "wishing": 14.0, "numcomments": 2.0, "numweights": 5.0, "averageweight": 2.4, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 322528, "name": "Don't Get Got!: Shut Up & Sit Down Special Edition", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_F9BoQZdftRZUmTV1Ov-w__thumb/img/rnODEUcLbuoAthD5gn2m1Q-Z31c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5739543.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_F9BoQZdftRZUmTV1Ov-w__original/img/3tzA5fx2FopI177IV5J5sjon8S8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5739543.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Bluffing', 'Humor', 'Party Game']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Acting']", "designers": "['Zoe Lee', 'James A.

"description": "Red Poppies Campaigns (RPC) enables players to game WWI battles from the perspective of battalion and regimental command posts.  Players unleash opening bombardments and then maneuver infantry companies against machine gun fire to fight battles on historically accurate maps of actual battlefields.  The streamlined system for fire and movement enables a rapid ebb and flow with minimal dice rolling and lots of historical chrome.  Generally speaking, units can move or fire once per turn \u2013 machine gun fire is the notable, unpredictable exception \u2013 and can initiate melee after a move.  Fire resolution requires only one dice roll, made by the target and modified for the relevant circumstances such as incoming firepower, terrain, visibility, etc.  Throughout, players must effectively manage the dynamic tension between top down control and bottom up initiative to get their units onto the objective before their ever-eroding control crumbles to nil.\n\nA tragic irony of WWI unifies all aspects of game play.  For most of the war, effective command and control of tactical units required a degree of concentration which threatened their survival.  In other words, the game illustrates the inverse relationship between a unit\u2019s responsiveness to orders and its durability.  So players must \u201cform\u201d infantry units to get them moving and then \u201cdisperse\u201d them at the right moment to hold the ground gained.  Enemy fire can force premature dispersion which must be remedied to get an attack moving again.  For infantry, the formed condition represents troops arrayed for the convenience of top down command such as those deployed in skirmish line or a column-of-march while the dispersed condition represents troops spread out and hunkered down for their own survival.\n\nThe game illustrates the evolution of tactics during WWI.  In time, gas wafts across the battlefield, unit statistics change to show better performance while dispersed, a new method of tactical command and control (the \u201cblob\u201d) emerges, mortars pop up like mushrooms after the rain, and artillery becomes more responsive.  In addition to short, standalone scenarios, RPC has a \u201ccampaign\u201d mechanism so players can link a series of interdependent scenarios to simulate battles that spanned days, and nights.  During these campaigns, the results of one scenario affect the start of another so conservation of force, supply lines, and replacements all become issues.  Players will get a sense of slogging forward in yards per day - at great cost \u2013 as they plot days of grinding combat.\n\nProduct Information\n\n     Complexity:                 6 out of 10\n     Solitaire suitability:      8 out of 10\n     Time Scale:                 10 minutes per turn\n     Map Scale:                  200 yards per hex\n     Unit Scale:                 Companies, squadrons, sections\n\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2016.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1440.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 1440.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 88, 'average': 7.75039, 'bayesaverage': 5.59809, 'stddev': 1.56783, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 371, 'trading': 7, 'wanting': 53, 'wishing': 116, 'numcomments': 44, 'numweights': 9, 'averageweight': 2.8889, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 7805}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1012}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 3, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 2, 'recommended_rating': 1, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 88.0, "average": 7.75039, "bayesaverage": 5.59809, "stddev": 1.56783, "median": 0.0, "owned": 371.0, "trading": 7.0, "wanting": 53.0, "wishing": 116.0, "numcomments": 44.0, "numweights": 9.0, "averageweight": 2.8889, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 7805}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 1012}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 12889, "name": "La Bataille de Ligny", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5KTHQ2dB-xiEIe6HQe8MSg__thumb/img/r_-daZ2hNolSrjUnt_7lKbJGRvo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7043037.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5KTHQ2dB-xiEIe6HQe8MSg__original/img/A2rgQpcXtHA0dhmpeaWW_sJxkm0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7043037.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Cities: Fleurus (Belgium)', 'Country: Belgium', 'Country: France', 'Series: La Bataille (Clash of Arms Games)']", "categories": "['Napoleonic', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Ed Wimble']", "artists": "['Rick Barber', 'Charles Kibler', 'Terry Leeds', 'Timothy Schleif', 'Robert Tunstall']", "publishers": "['AGEMA', 'Clash of Arms Games']", "description": "The first of the COA games detailing the climactic moments of Napoleon's last 100 days as Emperor.

A roll-to-hit system enables air and (optional) naval combat to scale from the small dogfights of the Fokker Scourge to the mighty clash of dreadnoughts at Jutland. On land, corps entrench by flipping which opens up an in-hex dimension for every trench battle to simulate the tactical ebb and flow that animated the front even during strategic \"stalemate\".\n\nSince victory hinges on territorial control, the opposing sides feed men into the mill hoping to win a war of attrition before accumulated demoralization triggers a domestic political crisis to upset their balance. The prospect of a \"breakthrough\" to the green fields beyond motivates ceaseless attacks, but it's ephemeral until tanks and planes arrive in numbers. The presence of specific admirals and generals, including the U-boat ace Lothar von Arnauld de la Periere, makes the game personal.\n\nA haggle-based diplomacy system enables history buffs to recreate the land-swap politics of the period, or players can opt for a simpler, streamlined schedule of neutral entry with a dash of randomness added for surprise. Production is as simple as 1-2-3 to avoid excessive math while enabling players to comprehend the \"cost\" of their losses.

Three battles from Jackson\u2019s 1862 Valley Campaign are featured.\n\n    Kernstown, March 23, 1862\n    Winchester, May 25, 1862\n    Cross Keys and Port Republic, June 8-9, 1862\n\n\nFive Battles of the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864\n\n    New Market, May 15, 1864\n    2nd Kernstown, July 24, 1864\n    3rd Winchester, September 19, 1864\n    Fisher's Hill, September 22, 1864\n    Cedar Creek, October 19, 1864 \n\n\nThe Great Battles of the American Civil War Series:\n\nThis series is one of the hobby\u2019s longest-lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental level Gettysburg game \u2013 Terrible Swift Sword (SPI) \u2013 designed by Richard Berg in 1976. Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable, but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles. The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the oftentimes-chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level.\n\nChanges have been made to the series rules for Death Valley in order to enhance their clarity and simulation value. Veteran players will find the revised rules to be very familiar, with the main differences being in the user-friendliness of the rulebook, as well as how the game \"feels\", especially for players versed in Civil War tactics.\n\nComponents:\n    1960 counters\n    Three 22\" x 34\" double-sided maps\n    Two 17\" x 22\" double-sided maps\n    One GBACW series rules booklet\n    Two Battle booklets\n    Sixteen Activation and Turn Record charts\n    Two Player Aid Cards\n    One Terrain Effects Chart\n    One 2nd Disorder Chart\n    Two 10-sided dice\n\nTIME SCALE: Each Turn = 1 Hour\nMAP SCALE: 145 Yards Per Hex with 25-Foot Elevations\nUNIT SCALE: 50 Men or 1 Cannon per Strength Point\n\ndescription from GMT website\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '334358', 'name': 'Battles For the Shenandoah: A Death Valley Expansion'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2019.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 300.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 170, 'average': 8.55647, 'bayesaverage': 5.73211, 'stddev': 1.19316, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 851, 'trading': 20, 'wanting': 21, 'wishing': 92, 'numcomments': 79, 'numweights': 13, 'averageweight': 4.2308, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4770}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 309}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 3, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 3, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 170.0, "average": 8.55647, "bayesaverage": 5.73211, "stddev": 1.19316, "median": 0.0, "owned": 851.0, "trading": 20.0, "wanting": 21.0, "wishing": 92.0, "numcomments": 79.0, "numweights": 13.0, "averageweight": 4.2308, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 4770}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 309}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 224354, "name": "Russia Besieged: Deluxe Edition", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zBWhZ8uIF1pZWaHUKbmVwQ__thumb/img/GNfuDf-23Jg-VbWlbAAwC80U734=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3494237.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zBWhZ8uIF1pZWaHUKbmVwQ__original/img/uPb8_RQpIe56XPaiIbEumm3AAjg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3494237.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Bulgaria', 'Country: Estonia', 'Country: Finland', 'Country: Germany', 'Country: Hungary', 'Country: Italy', 'Country: Latvia', 'Country: Lithuania', 'Country: Romania', 'Country: Russia', 'Country: Turkey', 'Country: Ukraine', 'History: World War II (Eastern Front)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "['Russia Besieged']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']", "designers": "['Art Lupinacci']", "artists": "['Art Lupinacci']", "publishers": "['Compass Games']", "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nThe time is June 22nd, 1941. Over 3 million German troops are poised on the Russian border preparing to launch Operation Barbarossa! What was supposed to be a quick campaign ended up marking the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany.\n\u00a0\nFrom Award Winning designer, Art Lupinacci, Russia Besieged covers the entire German campaign in the east from 1941 to the bitter end, in 1945. One of the finest Army/Corps level games on the market, Russia Besieged Deluxe edition has been overhauled from years of experience and nuances discovered in Tournament play, to bring you a richly detailed, east front experience you expect to see from this classic wargame.\n\u00a0\nTwo large maps cover the territory from Berlin to Archangel to Astrakhan down to Bucharest, all to accommodate 5/8\u201d counters! Rich in design features, the game simulates unit breakdowns, surrounded cities, Blitzkrieg attacks, a double impulse movement and attack system, two impulse turns, multi-weather turns and much, much more.\n\u00a0\nAs the German player, you experience many of the challenges experienced by the German commanders on the Eastern Front. Do you channel your forces to Leningrad? Push for Moscow? Or go for the oil rich regions of the Caucasus Mountains? All a tough call as each looks attainable, if you only had another couple of units more on the map!\n\u00a0\nEarly victories quickly change to difficult advances to the point where you make that fateful decision to go on the strategic withdrawal to fend off defeat. Or not! Sudden Death Victory conditions can be met at any time during the struggle.\n\u00a0\nAs the Russian player, the first year of the war is a nail-biter! German troops pour deep into Russia as you husband your forces to blunt the most dangerous attacks, giving up ground grudgingly as you pray for the early onset of Winter. Snow brings respite and fresh forces. But, the relief is short lived as the warm weather of 1942 brings new challenges. A rejuvenated German Army, a shadow of the initial invasion force, is still a force to be reckoned with! Unable to attack everywhere, the German will marshal his panzers and push where he feels success will bring decisive victory. Can you stop him!\n\u00a0\nRussia Besieged is a multi-layered game experience that includes not only pushing counters on the map, players must also take into account their side\u2019s War Economy. The Russian player must deal with production of troops and oil to rebuild depleted forces while the German is on a constant struggle with replacement points to rebuild a proper mix of units to defeat the Red Horde!\n\u00a0\nCan you do better than the historical counterparts?

These cards list different elements that must be compared to the car you are overtaking.\n\nFor example, You succeed if CAR + ENGINE + ENGINEER ratings are higher.\n\nThis is the crux of the game.

As status always gravitates to a central position players must continually \"politik\" to reach their goal.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1983.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 7.0, "playingtime": 12000.0, "minplaytime": 120.0, "maxplaytime": 12000.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1282, 'average': 7.61965, 'bayesaverage': 6.29411, 'stddev': 1.775, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 2240, 'trading': 68, 'wanting': 71, 'wishing': 390, 'numcomments': 543, 'numweights': 212, 'averageweight': 4.4057, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 1577}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 109}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 45, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 4, 'not_recommended_rating': 28}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 7, 'not_recommended_rating': 24}, '3': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 8, 'not_recommended_rating': 20}, '4': {'best_rating': 1, 'recommended_rating': 10, 'not_recommended_rating': 20}, '5': {'best_rating': 4, 'recommended_rating': 18, 'not_recommended_rating': 9}, '6': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 21, 'not_recommended_rating': 6}, '7': {'best_rating': 39, 'recommended_rating': 3, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '7+': {'best_rating': 8, 'recommended_rating': 10, 'not_recommended_rating': 10}}}", "usersrated": 1282.0, "average": 7.61965, "bayesaverage": 6.29411, "stddev": 1.775, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2240.0, "trading": 68.0, "wanting": 71.0, "wishing": 390.0, "numcomments": 543.0, "numweights": 212.0, "averageweight": 4.4057, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 1577}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 109}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "7", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 270, "name": "Advanced Third Reich", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o_9Fdqs4Xiyi6nvyTJT0QQ__thumb/img/o7WCUWTqNsTnH-YMo9K8aXv84Gc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5417225.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o_9Fdqs4Xiyi6nvyTJT0QQ__original/img/iWDSqLwV2ptlqNVG0wf0IS4xdUs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5417225.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Components: Map (Continental / National scale)', 'Continents: Europe', 'Series: Third Reich (Avalon Hill and others)']", "categories": "['Wargame', 'World War II']", "implementations": "['A World at War', 'Rise and Decline of the Third Reich']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks']", "designers": "['Bruce Harper']", "artists": "['Charles Kibler']", "publishers": "['The Avalon Hill Game Co']", "description": "Advanced Third Reich is a board wargame published originally by The Avalon Hill Game Co.

The Barbarossa scenario also has an early start option with some historically plausible options for allowing this.  The '42 scenario, while historical, is quite imbalanced in favor of the Axis player.  Is a great way to practice the Summer '42 turns though so it is certainly recommended.  Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.  It is the best way to learn the strengths of the Soviet side.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsolidated Rulebook\n\nThe Avalon Hill Game Company (TAHGC) quickly released a few important errata for the printed game.  This was released in GENERAL 22-4.  Then, two years later, extensive errata was released in GENERAL 24-1.  Both of these are available for download in the 'files' section below.  However, a new digital rulebook is available for download with all errata already incorporated.  This is also available in the 'files' section.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Wargame Academy Tournament Rules\n\nVarious rules are subject to interpretation.  The stated goal of the Wargame Academy is to provide a tournament rulebook where interpretive rules are explicitly stated with only one ruling.  This will enable tournament play.  Visit www.wargameacademy.org for more information and for a copy of the book.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMap Extensions\n\nSome players through the years desired a bit more space on the map.  To that end custom map extensions have been designed by more than one player.  The VASSAL module now has map extensions available as an option for play.  West to Berlin, Northeast to Archangel, and Southeast to Baku are all included.  Later these extensions will be available for download in a printable file.\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 1985.0, "minplayers": 2.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 480.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 12.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 686, 'average': 7.23582, 'bayesaverage': 5.92326, 'stddev': 1.52639, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 1588, 'trading': 54, 'wanting': 33, 'wishing': 86, 'numcomments': 295, 'numweights': 95, 'averageweight': 3.3053, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3080}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 305}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 16, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 8, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}, '2': {'best_rating': 16, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 5}}}", "usersrated": 686.0, "average": 7.23582, "bayesaverage": 5.92326, "stddev": 1.52639, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1588.0, "trading": 54.0, "wanting": 33.0, "wishing": 86.0, "numcomments": 295.0, "numweights": 95.0, "averageweight": 3.3053, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 3080}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 305}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 297955, "name": "The Korean War: June 1950 \u2013 May 1951, Designer Signature Edition", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dEYZQ0p19GSeTYEkdFoXww__thumb/img/K-kTtJFrBuPVqvYJ9RU1ISOstuU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5226807.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dEYZQ0p19GSeTYEkdFoXww__original/img/X6fUIgEkDRLmY3lShur0H-eTZcA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5226807.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Country: Korea', \"Decades: The 1950's\", 'History: Cold War', 'Players: Games with Solitaire Rules', 'Players: Wargames with Solitaire Rules', 'Series: Designer Signature Edition (Compass Games)']", "categories": "['Korean War', 'Modern Warfare', 'Wargame']", "implementations": "['The Korean War June 1950-May 1951']", "mechanics": "['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Zone of Control']", "designers": "['Joseph M.

Hailed by many as of the premier games covering The Korean War, this two-player operational level simulation covers the first year of the Korean conflict, from June 1950 to May 1951.\n\nDuring this period, the United States found itself involved in a bitter struggle in a remote Asian land that many Americans had not even heard of. Amid the debacles and stunning victories of the first year of war, the very foundation of the American military system \u2014 so recently triumphant in the Second World War \u2014 was severely shaken. In a war that few Americans understood and which historians have tended to ignore, the foundation of future American diplomacy in the face of communism was laid.\n\nThe players control ground and air forces of the United Nations, North Korea, and Communist China. Each player's force consists of a wide variety of units, including infantry, marines, paratroopers, armor, and aircraft. The map is a 1:750,000 representation of the Korean peninsula from Pusan in the south to the Yalu River in the north. In addition to controlling military forces, the players must make a number of political decisions that have an important effect on the game. Above all, the UN player must strive to keep international tensions at a minimum for the purpose of preventing World War Three. Intense escalation and mobilization could have disastrous consequences for the militarily-unprepared United States. On the other hand, insufficient force applied to Korea could lead to the conquest of South Korea by North Korean communists.\n\nThis edition of The Korean War features a super-sized map and larger counters and is another Classic Reborn! by Compass.\n\nThis Designer Signature edition of the classic Joseph Balkoski game goes beyond merely incorporating errata found from the original edition; it includes enhancements that include:\n\n\n     Larger and easier-to-read 9/16\u201d counters and three game maps\n     Game map information is updated and includes all-new map artwork\n     Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts\n     Restrictions on UN build-up and breakdown so UN player cannot perpetually continue Action Phase by reorganizing units\n     Modified amphibious assault system that allows UN player to more effectively recreate September 1950 Inchon invasion\n     Modified victory conditions that lessen impact of Global Tension\n     New random events to make the operation a bit more unpredictable\n     Updated rules treatment backed by many illustrations, an index, and clarifications and examples of play to reduce potential questions.\n     Updated historical notes\n\n\nProduct Information:\n\nComplexity: 7 out of 10\nSolitaire Suitability: 6 out of 10 (landing options; no hidden units)\nTime Scale: one month per turn\nMap Scale: 7.5 miles per hex\nUnit Scale: battalions, regiments, brigades and divisions\nPlayers: one to two, best with two or more\nPlaying Time: 4-8 hours depending upon scenario, 20+ hours for campaign\n\nComponents:\n\nFour map sheets (42.5\" x 71\"overall map dimension)\nThree countersheets (9/16\" size)\nRules booklet with updated Historical Notes\nTwo charts and tables booklets\nOne ten-sided die\nBox and Lid\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": "[]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2021.0, "minplayers": 1.0, "maxplayers": 2.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 240.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 0.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 33, 'average': 7.37121, 'bayesaverage': 5.5276, 'stddev': 2.21404, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 199, 'trading': 8, 'wanting': 12, 'wishing': 55, 'numcomments': 19, 'numweights': 7, 'averageweight': 3.8571, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 13932}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2813}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 5, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 5, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 5, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 2, 'not_recommended_rating': 3}}}", "usersrated": 33.0, "average": 7.37121, "bayesaverage": 5.5276, "stddev": 2.21404, "median": 0.0, "owned": 199.0, "trading": 8.0, "wanting": 12.0, "wishing": 55.0, "numcomments": 19.0, "numweights": 7.0, "averageweight": 3.8571, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': 13932}, {'id': '4664', 'name': 'wargames', 'friendlyname': 'War Game Rank', 'value': 2813}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 317562, "name": "Mythwind", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pqu26JNQZB0jCcVDC18PKQ__thumb/img/R4WLcRpALnl-PJyq7Cvyh0dX2cc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6422235.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pqu26JNQZB0jCcVDC18PKQ__original/img/H66R4AERgf5JoiefCgm195rujzg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6422235.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": "['Admin: Better Description Needed!', 'Admin: Upcoming Releases', 'Category: Sandbox', 'Components: Game Trayz Inside', 'Crowdfunding: Kickstarter']", "categories": "['City Building', 'Fantasy', 'Farming', 'Mythology']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "['Cooperative Game', 'Role Playing', 'Worker Placement']", "designers": "['Nathan Lige', 'Brendan McCaskell']", "artists": "[]", "publishers": "['OOMM', 'Board Game Circus', 'Galakta']", "description": "Mythwind is a persistent-world, asymmetrical and cooperative boardgame where you become a pioneer in a whimsical fantasy world.\n\nPlayers take a unique role of a pioneer trying to establish a new community.

The Red Army then launches the Bagration operation. Bringing considerable resources, over 2 million men and 4,000 tanks, it aims to liberate Belorussia. Taken by surprise, the German Army Group Center collapses quickly. The Soviets then advance 600 km in a month, causing an unprecedented defeat to the Germans. They are stopped at the gates of Warsaw, where the insurgency that has just started will be ruthlessly suppressed.\n\nBut the Axis forces are not yet beaten and 10 months of fierce fighting will be necessary until the final victory.\n\nVictory Roads is a historical simulation retracing the campaign on the Eastern Front, from June 22, 1944, the day of the launch of the offensive Bagration in Byelorussia, until May 1945 in Berlin.\n\nVictory Roads uses the same game system as Liberty Roads, our wargame on the Western Front, from the D-Day to April 1945, while integrating the specific characteristics of this campaign. The counters are the divisions (Axis) and corps (Soviets) of both sides involved in the campaign.\n\nThe system focuses on the different structure of the two opposing armies. Supports represent the effects of various materiel, equipment, as well as specific battle events.\n\nPlayers who are used to play with Liberty Roads should find Victory Roads very familiar.\n\nThe main difference the game offers relies in the way to handle the Soviet player\u2019s offensive.

Tragic hilarity ensues.\n\n", "expansions": "[{'id': '229003', 'name': 'Decksistentialism: Conventions'}, {'id': '229002', 'name': 'Decksistentialism: Game Night'}]", "expands": "[]", "yearpublished": 2017.0, "minplayers": 3.0, "maxplayers": 99.0, "playingtime": 1200.0, "minplaytime": 10.0, "maxplaytime": 1200.0, "minage": 14.0, "stats": "{'usersrated': 1, 'average': 10.0, 'bayesaverage': 0.0, 'stddev': 0.0, 'median': 0.0, 'owned': 3, 'trading': 0, 'wanting': 0, 'wishing': 4, 'numcomments': 2, 'numweights': 0, 'averageweight': 0.0, 'ranks': [{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]}", "suggested_players": "{'total_votes': 0, 'results': {'1': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '2': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '3': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '4': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '5': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '6': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '7': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '8': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '9': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '10': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '11': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '12': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '13': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '14': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '15': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '16': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '17': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '18': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '19': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '20': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '21': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '22': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '23': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '24': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '25': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '26': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '27': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '28': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '29': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '30': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}, '30+': {'best_rating': 0, 'recommended_rating': 0, 'not_recommended_rating': 0}}}", "usersrated": 1.0, "average": 10.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3.0, "trading": 0.0, "wanting": 0.0, "wishing": 4.0, "numcomments": 2.0, "numweights": 0.0, "averageweight": 0.0, "ranks": "[{'id': '1', 'name': 'boardgame', 'friendlyname': 'Board Game Rank', 'value': None}]", "game_family": null, "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "30+", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false, "bga": false}, {"id": 229002, "name": "Decksistentialism: Game Night", "alternative_names": "[]", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YVsKunD7qH4NYJCUGIM4vQ__thumb/img/C4CRM_YVsmCqrrZO2gNgGTpukjs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3587328.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YVsKunD7qH4NYJCUGIM4vQ__original/img/Zr7gZy1CYFkHjKsgNsUEIJ1YXTQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3587328.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": "[]", "categories": "['Card Game']", "implementations": "[]", "mechanics": "[]", "designers": "['Alex Cutler', 'Matt Fantastic']", "artists": "['Matt Fantastic']", "publishers": "['Prettiest Princess Games']", "description": "Decksistentialism: Game Night consists of nine cards for Decksistentialism that are specifically focused around game nights.
