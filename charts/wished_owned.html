broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\n\nThe game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections.\n\nTaking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five\u2014but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose.

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.\n\nSpirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.\n\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.\n\nThe islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\n\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.\n\nAt game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.\n\nThe game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "193065", "name": "Spirit Island: Branch & Claw"}, {"id": "245664", "name": "Spirit Island: Champions of the Dahan Token Pack"}, {"id": "244827", "name": "Spirit Island: Expansion Playmat"}, {"id": "262722", "name": "Spirit Island: Jagged Earth"}, {"id": "232394", "name": "Spirit Island: Promo Pack 1"}, {"id": "263778", "name": "Spirit Island: Promo Pack 2"}, {"id": "292800", "name": "Spirit Island: Seele des Fl\u00e4chenbrands"}, {"id": "275756", "name": "Spirit Island: Unter der Insel schlummernde Schlange"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 23352, "average": 8.32944, "bayesaverage": 8.07604, "stddev": 1.45396, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34282, "trading": 251, "wanting": 1829, "wishing": 12857, "numcomments": 4009, "numweights": 1267, "averageweight": 4.0008, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 13}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 11}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 811, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 189, "recommended_rating": 428, "not_recommended_rating": 55}, "2": {"best_rating": 514, "recommended_rating": 223, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3": {"best_rating": 253, "recommended_rating": 369, "not_recommended_rating": 38}, "4": {"best_rating": 74, "recommended_rating": 293, "not_recommended_rating": 246}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 388}}}, "usersrated": 23352.0, "average": 8.32944, "bayesaverage": 8.07604, "stddev": 1.45396, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34282.0, "trading": 251.0, "wanting": 1829.0, "wishing": 12857.0, "numcomments": 4009.0, "numweights": 1267.0, "averageweight": 4.0008, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 13}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 11}], "game_family": "Spirit Island", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "242277", "name": "Scythe: The Rise of Fenris", "alternative_names": ["Scythe: A Fenris felemelked\u00e9se", "Scythe: Aufstand der Fenris", "Scythe: Aufstieg der Fenris", "Scythe: El auge de Fenris", "Scythe: Fenris Powstaje", "Scythe: L'\u00c9veil de Fenris", "Scythe: Le R\u00e9veil de Fenris", "Scythe: Vzestup Fenrise", "\u0421\u0435\u0440\u043f: \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0424\u0435\u043d\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba-\u5927\u938c\u6226\u5f79-\u62e1\u5f35\u3000\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30ea\u30b9\u8972\u6765", "\uc0ac\uc774\ub4dc: \ub77c\uc774\uc988 \uc624\ube0c \ud39c\ub9ac\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GRp__UYY-wM-i2fg4Qzefw__thumb/img/qLl_YEnA_TiXfhinS8yqAARKUFY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3911078.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GRp__UYY-wM-i2fg4Qzefw__original/img/A7cbJrXINiWGcAXKQ2HnTZP8afw=/0x0/pic3911078.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Scythe", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Mech Warfare"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Economic", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Ryan Lopez DeVinaspre", "Jamey Stegmaier"], "artists": ["Jakub Rozalski"], "publishers": ["Stonemaier Games", "Albi", "Arclight", "CrowD Games", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Feuerland Spiele", "Ghenos Games", "Maldito Games", "Matagot", "PHALANX", "sternenschimmermeer"], "description": "Empires have risen and fallen in the aftermath of the Great War, and Europa stands on the precipice of a new era.

It's also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach.

Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.\n\nAs in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.\n\nEach round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):\n\n1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.\n2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.\n3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.\n4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.\n5) Loan - Take a \u00a330 loan and reduce your income.\n\nBrass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:\n\n6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)\n\nThe game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.\n\nBirmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.\n\nIron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.\n\nNew \"Sell\" system\n\nBrewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also \"grease the wheels of industry\" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.\n\nBirmingham features three all-new industry types:\n\nBrewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.\n\nManufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.\n\nPottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.\n\nIncreased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to \u00a38 per cube, and it's not uncommon.\n\nBrass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 17355, "average": 8.65531, "bayesaverage": 8.35294, "stddev": 1.26242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25741, "trading": 67, "wanting": 1375, "wishing": 8921, "numcomments": 2751, "numweights": 812, "averageweight": 3.9101, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 3}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 406, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 204}, "2": {"best_rating": 45, "recommended_rating": 250, "not_recommended_rating": 44}, "3": {"best_rating": 212, "recommended_rating": 124, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 185, "recommended_rating": 130, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 164}}}, "usersrated": 17355.0, "average": 8.65531, "bayesaverage": 8.35294, "stddev": 1.26242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25741.0, "trading": 67.0, "wanting": 1375.0, "wishing": 8921.0, "numcomments": 2751.0, "numweights": 812.0, "averageweight": 3.9101, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 3}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 3}], "game_family": "Brass", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "224783", "name": "Vindication", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kEIlWY3rg27NgmVBZkFyg__thumb/img/NYzya2nOQJaZolgQGxKXiBd_O6g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4101638.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kEIlWY3rg27NgmVBZkFyg__original/img/IaeMjblsJR_kI9lP3M7LWTcZnTE=/0x0/pic4101638.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Game Trayz Inside", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "categories": ["Fantasy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hexagon Grid", "Modular Board", "Variable Phase Order"], "designers": ["Marc Neidlinger"], "artists": ["Noah Adelman", "Brett Carville", "Emiliano Cordoba", "Bartek Fedyczak", "Noemi Konkoly", "Phu Thieu"], "publishers": ["Orange Nebula, LLC"], "description": "Vindication (formerly Epoch: The Awakening) is a highly strategic, fantasy-based tabletop journey for 2-5 players.

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.\n\nThe game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.\n\nEach round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.\n\nIf they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.\n\nThe player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.\n\nThe game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.\n\nWelcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "211083", "name": "Welcome Back to the Dungeon: Easter Egg"}, {"id": "193533", "name": "Welcome to the Dungeon: Toad Promo"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 11450, "average": 6.61004, "bayesaverage": 6.4631, "stddev": 1.20268, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20136, "trading": 565, "wanting": 145, "wishing": 1483, "numcomments": 1963, "numweights": 313, "averageweight": 1.2268, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1065}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 83}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 315}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 145, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 94}, "2": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 82, "not_recommended_rating": 29}, "3": {"best_rating": 95, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 53, "recommended_rating": 60, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 79}}}, "usersrated": 11450.0, "average": 6.61004, "bayesaverage": 6.4631, "stddev": 1.20268, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20136.0, "trading": 565.0, "wanting": 145.0, "wishing": 1483.0, "numcomments": 1963.0, "numweights": 313.0, "averageweight": 1.2268, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1065}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 83}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 315}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "150376", "name": "Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game", "alternative_names": ["Dead of Winter: A la crois\u00e9e des chemins", "Dead of Winter: Edizione Italiana", "Dead of Winter: Um Jogo de Encruzilhadas", "Dead of Winter: Un Juego de Encrucijadas", "Holtak tele: V\u00e1lasz\u00faton", "Martwa Zima: Gra rozdro\u017cy", "Winter der Toten: Ein Spiel mit dem Schicksal", "Zima Mrtv\u00fdch: Cesty Osudu", "\u041c\u0451\u0440\u0442\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0451\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0438", "\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c\u0e21\u0e23\u0e13\u0e30", "\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc", "\u6b7b\u4ea1\u5bd2\u51ac", "\ub370\ub4dc \uc624\ube0c \uc708\ud130: \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4\ub85c\ub4dc \uac8c\uc784"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__thumb/img/foFGN8KwmN8BaYNpolq0HcMba4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3016500.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__original/img/pOYQOSR1CnXcN6pEPx3yFDjKFaA=/0x0/pic3016500.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Creatures: Zombies", "Series: Crossroads (Plaid Hat Games)", "Theme: Post-Apocalyptic"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Horror", "Zombies"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Narrative Choice / Paragraph", "Push Your Luck", "Semi-Cooperative Game", "Storytelling", "Trading", "Traitor Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "designers": ["Jonathan Gilmour", "Isaac Vega"], "artists": ["David Richards", "Fernanda Su\u00e1rez", "Peter Wocken"], "publishers": ["Plaid Hat Games", "Arclight", "Asmodee Italia", "Cube Factory of Ideas", "Edge Entertainment", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Game Harbor", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Gemenot", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "MINDOK", "Raven Distribution", "Siam Board Games"], "description": "\"Crossroads\" is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.\n\nDead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!\n\nDead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.\n\nDead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "181307", "name": "Dead of Winter: Andrea Smith"}, {"id": "218041", "name": "Dead of Winter: BGG Crossroads Promo"}, {"id": "180704", "name": "Dead of Winter: Dice Tower Crossroads Promo"}, {"id": "174152", "name": "Dead of Winter: Felicia Day"}, {"id": "280071", "name": "Dead of Winter: Giggles"}, {"id": "231562", "name": "Dead of Winter: KD James"}, {"id": "150482", "name": "Dead of Winter: Kodiak Colby"}, {"id": "171217", "name": "Dead of Winter: Lucky Luke Smith"}, {"id": "231563", "name": "Dead of Winter: Meryl Wolfe"}, {"id": "195656", "name": "Dead of Winter: Rich Sommer"}, {"id": "183785", "name": "Dead of Winter: Roberta Plum"}, {"id": "203824", "name": "Dead of Winter: Rodney Smith"}, {"id": "234258", "name": "Dead of Winter: Ruckus Burley"}, {"id": "206094", "name": "Dead of Winter: Warring Colonies"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 38573, "average": 7.58468, "bayesaverage": 7.43729, "stddev": 1.42628, "median": 0.0, "owned": 52205, "trading": 1169, "wanting": 823, "wishing": 8483, "numcomments": 5509, "numweights": 1432, "averageweight": 3.0147, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 116}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 41}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 574, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 336}, "2": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 124, "not_recommended_rating": 266}, "3": {"best_rating": 65, "recommended_rating": 368, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "4": {"best_rating": 392, "recommended_rating": 128, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "5": {"best_rating": 174, "recommended_rating": 220, "not_recommended_rating": 60}, "5+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 246}}}, "usersrated": 38573.0, "average": 7.58468, "bayesaverage": 7.43729, "stddev": 1.42628, "median": 0.0, "owned": 52205.0, "trading": 1169.0, "wanting": 823.0, "wishing": 8483.0, "numcomments": 5509.0, "numweights": 1432.0, "averageweight": 3.0147, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 116}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 41}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "39683", "name": "At the Gates of Loyang", "alternative_names": ["A las puertas de Loyang", "Alle Porte di Loyang", "Aux Portes de Loyang", "Loyang", "Voor de Poorten van Loyang", "Vor den Toren von Loyang", "\u6d1b\u9633\u57ce\u5916 (\u6d1b\u967d\u57ce\u5916)", "\u6d1b\u967d\u306e\u9580\u306b\u3066", "\ub904\uc591\uc758 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xnC5RT14H1CgAueR7VTPzw__thumb/img/xO8aUHS7cZPMJRg6gFXlP6LgZbw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3601060.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xnC5RT14H1CgAueR7VTPzw__original/img/heq9_9W9Dq6BA5mWQlQLnRuqp_E=/0x0/pic3601060.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: China", "Crowdfunding: Wspieram", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg)", "Theme: Nature"], "categories": ["Economic", "Farming"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Contracts", "Loans", "Market", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz", "Scott Hartman"], "publishers": ["Hall Games", "Tasty Minstrel Games", "999 Games", "Fullcap Games", "Hobby Japan", "Intrafin Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Maldito Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "Stratelibri", "Wargames Club Publishing", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "At the Gates of Loyang is a trading game in which you are able to produce goods by planting them and later selling them to customers.

Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.\n\nIn Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...\n\nIn more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:\n\n\n    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.\n    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.\n    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.\n    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.\n    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.\n\n\nWhen a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who's reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "204573", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016"}, {"id": "234191", "name": "Camel Up: The Referee Camel & Istanbul \u2013 Caravan Leader Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "207573", "name": "Istanbul: Caravan Leader Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "161224", "name": "Istanbul: Kebab Shop Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "192779", "name": "Istanbul: Letters & Seals"}, {"id": "172505", "name": "Istanbul: Mocha & Baksheesh"}, {"id": "213217", "name": "Istanbul: Pegasus Depot Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "293240", "name": "Super Power"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 40, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 24573, "average": 7.58222, "bayesaverage": 7.4331, "stddev": 1.14172, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29597, "trading": 399, "wanting": 899, "wishing": 4956, "numcomments": 3644, "numweights": 928, "averageweight": 2.5894, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 117}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 98}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 307, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 166}, "2": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 167, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "3": {"best_rating": 96, "recommended_rating": 146, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 185, "recommended_rating": 62, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 45, "recommended_rating": 142, "not_recommended_rating": 31}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 120}}}, "usersrated": 24573.0, "average": 7.58222, "bayesaverage": 7.4331, "stddev": 1.14172, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29597.0, "trading": 399.0, "wanting": 899.0, "wishing": 4956.0, "numcomments": 3644.0, "numweights": 928.0, "averageweight": 2.5894, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 117}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 98}], "game_family": "Istanbul (AEG)", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "148951", "name": "Tiny Epic Kingdoms", "alternative_names": ["Mal\u00e1 velk\u00e1 kr\u00e1lovstv\u00ed", "Ma\u0142e Epickie Kr\u00f3lestwa", "Peque\u00f1os Grandes Reinos", "Ultra-Tiny Epic Kingdoms", "Winzige Weltreiche", "\u041a\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u042d\u043f\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430", "\u5c0f\u5c0f\u53f2\u8bd7\u738b\u56fd"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rEBwFqk9b4rT-hrGOQnZrA__thumb/img/nIQB6TR1SMbF1W1Oq4OlhIbnao4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2947892.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rEBwFqk9b4rT-hrGOQnZrA__original/img/2Dha6G7HJnSW1FPmDB53Q18Lscc=/0x0/pic2947892.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Giochistarter", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Mechanism: 4X", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play", "Series: Tiny Epic (Gamelyn Games)"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Civilization", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Medieval", "Print & Play"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Follow", "Take That", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Scott Almes"], "artists": ["Scott Almes", "William Bricker", "Darrell Louder", "Benjamin Shulman"], "publishers": ["Gamelyn Games", "(Web published)", "Fullcap Games", "GaGa Games", "Giochix.it", "HomoLudicus", "MYBG Co., Ltd.", "REXhry", "Schwerkraft-Verlag"], "description": "You are a tiny kingdom with big ambition.

Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.\n\nThe more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?\n\nRailroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add new special rules to your games. The Deep Blue Edition includes the Rivers and Lakes expansions. Increase the difficulty by adding the River route into the mix, or use the Lakes to connect your networks by ferry. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different. Each box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more). The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "320731", "name": "Railroad Ink: Arcade Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320730", "name": "Railroad Ink: Eldritch Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320737", "name": "Railroad Ink: Electricity Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320734", "name": "Railroad Ink: Engineer Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320735", "name": "Railroad Ink: Future Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "263963", "name": "Railroad Ink: Promo Board #1 \u2013 Blue Train"}, {"id": "263964", "name": "Railroad Ink: Promo Board #2 \u2013 Red Train"}, {"id": "320736", "name": "Railroad Ink: Sky Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "320732", "name": "Railroad Ink: Underground Expansion Pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 6041, "average": 7.28625, "bayesaverage": 6.89872, "stddev": 1.15459, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10221, "trading": 108, "wanting": 332, "wishing": 2081, "numcomments": 860, "numweights": 100, "averageweight": 1.55, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 480}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 98}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 74, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "2": {"best_rating": 41, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 25, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 19, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "6": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "6+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 25}}}, "usersrated": 6041.0, "average": 7.28625, "bayesaverage": 6.89872, "stddev": 1.15459, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10221.0, "trading": 108.0, "wanting": 332.0, "wishing": 2081.0, "numcomments": 860.0, "numweights": 100.0, "averageweight": 1.55, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 480}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 98}], "game_family": "Railroad Ink", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "245655", "name": "The King's Dilemma", "alternative_names": ["El Dilema del Rey", "Le Dilemme du Roi", "Dylematy Kr\u00f3la", "\u0414\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044f"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FJlTdSMkK5hMNtCympJFmg__thumb/img/WqPUfQOfiIe5FnBXz-EAavw5jCs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5429837.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FJlTdSMkK5hMNtCympJFmg__original/img/GsipoxqbuzY89vTkiW7I3C9cJv4=/0x0/pic5429837.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Mechanism: Legacy"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Negotiation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Bias", "Legacy Game", "Traitor Game", "Voting"], "designers": ["Hjalmar Hach", "Lorenzo Silva"], "artists": ["Giorgio Baroni", "Giulia Ghigini"], "publishers": ["Horrible Guild", "999 Games", "Asmodee", "CrowD Games", "Galakta", "Ghenos Games", "HeidelB\u00c4R Games", "IELLO"], "description": "The King's Dilemma is an interactive narrative experience with legacy elements, featuring several branching storylines leading to many possible finales and an evolving deck of event cards at its core.

Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator\u2026 All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together.\n\nAt the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "231506", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017"}, {"id": "238664", "name": "Magic Maze: 9 new tiles"}, {"id": "234154", "name": "Magic Maze: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017 Promo"}, {"id": "260658", "name": "Magic Maze: Hidden Roles"}, {"id": "230359", "name": "Magic Maze: Maximum Security"}, {"id": "308036", "name": "Magic Maze: Technische Anlagen"}, {"id": "293240", "name": "Super Power"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 15, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 15, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 14999, "average": 7.06541, "bayesaverage": 6.8944, "stddev": 1.32031, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22864, "trading": 396, "wanting": 378, "wishing": 3408, "numcomments": 2170, "numweights": 244, "averageweight": 1.7336, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 484}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 117}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 262, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 127}, "2": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 99, "not_recommended_rating": 67}, "3": {"best_rating": 42, "recommended_rating": 133, "not_recommended_rating": 17}, "4": {"best_rating": 191, "recommended_rating": 31, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 45, "recommended_rating": 102, "not_recommended_rating": 31}, "6": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 49}, "7": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 90}, "8": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 45, "not_recommended_rating": 99}, "8+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 117}}}, "usersrated": 14999.0, "average": 7.06541, "bayesaverage": 6.8944, "stddev": 1.32031, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22864.0, "trading": 396.0, "wanting": 378.0, "wishing": 3408.0, "numcomments": 2170.0, "numweights": 244.0, "averageweight": 1.7336, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 484}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 117}], "game_family": "Magic Maze", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "266192", "name": "Wingspan", "alternative_names": ["Feszt\u00e1v", "Fl\u00fcgelschlag", "Na k\u0159\u00eddlech", "Na skrzyd\u0142ach", "\u0391\u039d\u039f\u0399\u0393\u039c\u0391 \u03a6\u03a4\u0395\u03a1\u03a9\u039d", "\u041a\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430", "\u041a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u044c\u044f", "\u0e1b\u0e35\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32", "\u30a6\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3", "\u5c55\u7fc5\u7ff1\u7fd4", "\uc719\uc2a4\ud32c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yLZJCVLlIx4c7eJEWUNJ7w__thumb/img/VNToqgS2-pOGU6MuvIkMPKn_y-s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4458123.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yLZJCVLlIx4c7eJEWUNJ7w__original/img/V_R5oe5Huj5guJaBhgbQkZR1PLE=/0x0/pic4458123.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Birds", "Animals: Crows / Ravens / Magpies", "Animals: Ducks", "Animals: Geese", "Animals: Owls", "Animals: Turkeys", "Components: Control Boards", "Components: Dice with Icons", "Components: Drop Tower", "Components: Game Trayz Inside", "Game: Wingspan", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Biology", "Theme: Nature"], "categories": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Educational"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Drafting", "End Game Bonuses", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game"], "designers": ["Elizabeth Hargrave"], "artists": ["Ana Maria Martinez Jaramillo", "Natalia Rojas", "Beth Sobel"], "publishers": ["Stonemaier Games", "999 Games", "Angry Lion Games", "Arclight", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Divercentro", "Feuerland Spiele", "Ghenos Games", "Green Elephant Games", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lavka Games", "Ludofy Creative", "Maldito Games", "Matagot", "MINDOK", "NeoTroy Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Regatul Jocurilor", "Siam Board Games", "Surfin' Meeple", "Surfin' Meeple China", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433"], "description": "Wingspan is\u00a0a competitive, medium-weight, card-driven, engine-building board game from Stonemaier Games.

To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.\n\nOn a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.\n\nWhen either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "167305", "name": "Qwixx gemixxt"}, {"id": "184530", "name": "Qwixx: Big Points"}, {"id": "320877", "name": "Qwixx: Bonus"}, {"id": "238002", "name": "Qwixx: Characters"}, {"id": "270715", "name": "Qwixx: Connected"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 15, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 15, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 9090, "average": 6.88166, "bayesaverage": 6.66571, "stddev": 1.17594, "median": 0.0, "owned": 16046, "trading": 175, "wanting": 68, "wishing": 614, "numcomments": 1692, "numweights": 369, "averageweight": 1.122, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 756}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 202}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 105, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 56}, "2": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 58, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "3": {"best_rating": 43, "recommended_rating": 44, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 57, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 41}}}, "usersrated": 9090.0, "average": 6.88166, "bayesaverage": 6.66571, "stddev": 1.17594, "median": 0.0, "owned": 16046.0, "trading": 175.0, "wanting": 68.0, "wishing": 614.0, "numcomments": 1692.0, "numweights": 369.0, "averageweight": 1.122, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 756}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 202}], "game_family": "Qwixx", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "131357", "name": "Coup", "alternative_names": ["Coup \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u062a\u0627", "Coup. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442", "Coup: City State", "Coup: Ciudad Corrupta", "Coup: No\u010dn\u00ed klub", "Coup: The Resistance Universe", "Coup: Urbis", "Entrika", "\u015awiatowy Konflikt", "\u03a4\u03bf \u039a\u03cc\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf", "\u03a4\u03bf \u039a\u03cc\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf: 2\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2", "\u05d4\u05e4\u05d9\u05db\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d9\u05e8-\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4", "\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e42\u0e04\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e33\u0e19\u0e32\u0e08", "\u30af\u30fc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MWhSY_GOe2-bmlQ2rntSVg__thumb/img/vuR_0PCX1w2EkjO_LbchOHZPOwU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2016054.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MWhSY_GOe2-bmlQ2rntSVg__original/img/4zmqrQ4v-rufRQM_oinFDQ6HykI=/0x0/pic2016054.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Series: Postcard Box Games (Indie Boards and Cards)", "Setting: Dystopian Universe (Indie Boards & Cards)"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction", "Party Game", "Political"], "implementations": ["Complots", "Coup Deluxe:  Mobile Edition", "Coup: Rebellion G54"], "mechanics": ["Hidden Roles", "Memory", "Player Elimination", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Rikki Tahta"], "artists": ["Luis Francisco", "Stephanie Gustafsson", "Andrew Higgins", "Alexandr Kiselev", "Prapach Lapamnuaysap", "Tomasz Larek", "Jarek Noco\u0144", "Guillermo H.

You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...\n\nIn Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.\n\nEach player starts the game with two coins and two influence \u2013 i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:\n\n\n     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.\n     Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.\n     Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.\n     Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.\n     Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.\n\n\nOn your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:\n\n\n     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.\n     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.\n     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)\n\n\nWhen you take one of the character actions \u2013 whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action \u2013 that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.\n\nIf you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.\n\nThe last player to still have influence \u2013 that is, a face-down character \u2013 wins the game!\n\nA new & optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards & Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.\n\n\n     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck. They then shuffle the old card into the Court deck.

the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.\n\nEach player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.\n\nThe resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.\n\nDuring each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \"Trader\" or \"Builder\"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \"Builder\" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.\n\nPuerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.\n\nPlayers earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player.

The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!\n\nDesigned by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard \"worker placement\" genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place \u2013 and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.\n\nAs befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "167309", "name": "Five Tribes: Dhenim"}, {"id": "220551", "name": "Five Tribes: Galbells"}, {"id": "176677", "name": "Five Tribes: The Artisans of Naqala"}, {"id": "199310", "name": "Five Tribes: The Thieves of Naqala"}, {"id": "226828", "name": "Five Tribes: Whims of the Sultan"}, {"id": "176234", "name": "Five Tribes: Wilwit"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 80, "minplaytime": 40, "maxplaytime": 80, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 31439, "average": 7.77873, "bayesaverage": 7.63217, "stddev": 1.27987, "median": 0.0, "owned": 40553, "trading": 392, "wanting": 1311, "wishing": 8920, "numcomments": 4813, "numweights": 1217, "averageweight": 2.8521, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 63}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 59}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 659, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 300}, "2": {"best_rating": 325, "recommended_rating": 223, "not_recommended_rating": 54}, "3": {"best_rating": 222, "recommended_rating": 304, "not_recommended_rating": 21}, "4": {"best_rating": 167, "recommended_rating": 276, "not_recommended_rating": 97}, "4+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 281}}}, "usersrated": 31439.0, "average": 7.77873, "bayesaverage": 7.63217, "stddev": 1.27987, "median": 0.0, "owned": 40553.0, "trading": 392.0, "wanting": 1311.0, "wishing": 8920.0, "numcomments": 4813.0, "numweights": 1217.0, "averageweight": 2.8521, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 63}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 59}], "game_family": "Five Tribes", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "283355", "name": "Dune", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2fgPg6Be--w97zoycObUgg__thumb/img/OrjzwJVfE8Qnk8e5efbae5EaSeY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4815198.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2fgPg6Be--w97zoycObUgg__original/img/MhbVaQPBZ9ez2TpMl20xGHQ6hno=/0x0/pic4815198.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Books: Dune", "Theme: Deserts"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Fighting", "Negotiation", "Novel-based", "Political", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "implementations": ["Dune"], "mechanics": ["Alliances", "Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Bribery", "Force Commitment", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Bill Eberle", "Jack Kittredge", "Peter Olotka"], "artists": ["Ilya Baranovsky"], "publishers": ["Gale Force Nine, LLC"], "description": "Imagine you can control the forces of a noble family, guild, or religious order on a barren planet which is the only source for the most valuable substance in the known universe.\n\nImagine you can rewrite the script for one of the most famous science fiction books of all time.

Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.\n\nElder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.\n\nTo locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "237518", "name": "Elder Sign: Arkham Nights 2017 Promotional Investigator Cards"}, {"id": "263228", "name": "Elder Sign: Daniela Reyes Promo Card"}, {"id": "116304", "name": "Elder Sign: Daoloth Promo Card"}, {"id": "166679", "name": "Elder Sign: Gates of Arkham"}, {"id": "198045", "name": "Elder Sign: Grave Consequences"}, {"id": "207867", "name": "Elder Sign: Hastur Promo Card"}, {"id": "189807", "name": "Elder Sign: Omens of Ice"}, {"id": "212572", "name": "Elder Sign: Omens of the Deep"}, {"id": "237226", "name": "Elder Sign: Omens of the Pharaoh"}, {"id": "132684", "name": "Elder Sign: Shub-Niggurath Promo Card"}, {"id": "167930", "name": "Elder Sign: The Dark God Promo Card"}, {"id": "129415", "name": "Elder Sign: The Hand of Solace \u2013 Promotional Adventure Card"}, {"id": "131931", "name": "Elder Sign: The Log of the Persephone \u2013 Promotional Adventure Card"}, {"id": "184253", "name": "Elder Sign: Ubbo-Sathla Promo Card"}, {"id": "137479", "name": "Elder Sign: Unseen Forces"}, {"id": "150884", "name": "Elder Sign: Yog-Sothoth Promo Card"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 21805, "average": 6.98319, "bayesaverage": 6.82847, "stddev": 1.39045, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34962, "trading": 882, "wanting": 325, "wishing": 3103, "numcomments": 4408, "numweights": 1068, "averageweight": 2.3502, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 542}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 174}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 387, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 86, "recommended_rating": 192, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "2": {"best_rating": 97, "recommended_rating": 195, "not_recommended_rating": 17}, "3": {"best_rating": 111, "recommended_rating": 165, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "4": {"best_rating": 152, "recommended_rating": 123, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "5": {"best_rating": 28, "recommended_rating": 86, "not_recommended_rating": 131}, "6": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 66, "not_recommended_rating": 162}, "7": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 31, "not_recommended_rating": 201}, "8": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 31, "not_recommended_rating": 206}, "8+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 198}}}, "usersrated": 21805.0, "average": 6.98319, "bayesaverage": 6.82847, "stddev": 1.39045, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34962.0, "trading": 882.0, "wanting": 325.0, "wishing": 3103.0, "numcomments": 4408.0, "numweights": 1068.0, "averageweight": 2.3502, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 542}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 174}], "game_family": "Elder Sign", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 16, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "223555", "name": "Scythe: The Wind Gambit", "alternative_names": ["Scythe: Csap\u00e1s a fellegekb\u0151l", "Scythe: Igraj\u0105c z Wiatrem", "Scythe: Kolosse der L\u00fcfte", "Scythe: Strat\u00e8ges des cieux", "Scythe: Tit\u00e1ni nebes", "Scythe: Vientos de guerra y paz", "\u0421\u0435\u0440\u043f. \u041d\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0438\u0442", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba: \u5927\u938c\u6226\u5f79 \u2013 \u62e1\u5f35 \u98a8\u306b\u821e\u3046\u7b56\u8b00", "\u9570\u5200\u6218\u4e89:\u98ce\u4e2d\u7684\u8be1\u8ba1", "\uc0ac\uc774\ub4dc: \uc708\ub4dc \uac2c\ube57", "\uc0ac\uc774\uc4f0: \uc708\ub4dc \uac2c\ube57"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kcp2L5EPPr-okBb1jCtxpA__thumb/img/WgVl13rTR8CIJos1iBek5BEbRbc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3487272.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kcp2L5EPPr-okBb1jCtxpA__original/img/LH298dHMe4ltRu6bNerlqv2gS0Q=/0x0/pic3487272.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Scythe", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Alternate History"], "categories": ["Economic", "Expansion for Base-game", "Transportation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Point to Point Movement"], "designers": ["Kai Starck", "Jamey Stegmaier"], "artists": ["Jakub Rozalski", "Jamey Stegmaier"], "publishers": ["Stonemaier Games", "Albi", "Angry Lion Games", "Arclight", "CrowD Games", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Feuerland Spiele", "Ghenos Games", "Maldito Games", "Matagot", "PHALANX", "Playfun Games", "sternenschimmermeer"], "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nMankind has long been confined to travel by land and sea, but a new technology has emerged from the greatest minds in Eastern Europa: airships. These steam-driven behemoths sail freely across the sky, aiding their empire's expansion through innovation and confrontation. As the years pass, the world has come to understand that no single faction will rise above the rest for any span of time. In the hope of decreasing the conflict and increasing the peace, leaders of Europa begin to gather each year to declare a new way for the factions to resolve their differences.\n\nScythe: The Wind Gambit, an expansion for Scythe, adds two new modules that can be played together or separately at any player count and with either the base game on its own or with other Scythe expansions:\n\n\u2022 Airships: (1 miniature per faction; 16 tiles) An airship is a new type of unit that is distinctly different from characters, mechs, and workers. Unlike those units, airships never control territories. Airships are moved via a Move action, and rivers and lakes do not constrain their movement.

"Description from BoardgameNews\n\nIn Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?\n\nThe game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.\n\nAgricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).\nEach player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.\nProblem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.\nEach player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "59158", "name": "Agricola CZ-Deck"}, {"id": "113413",

Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.\n Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?\n\nOf course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.\n\nGalaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.\n\nBuilding happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.\n\nOnce building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.\n\nMost of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!\n\n3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "97845", "name": "Galaxy Trucker: Another Big Expansion"}, {"id": "40484", "name": "Galaxy Trucker: Bonus Cards"}, {"id": "132435", "name": "Galaxy Trucker: Even-Steven Cards"}, {"id": "144227", "name": "Galaxy Trucker: Latest Models"}, {"id": "182027", "name": "Galaxy Trucker: Missions"}, {"id": "33963", "name": "Galaxy Trucker: Rough Road Ahead"}, {"id": "38378", "name": "Galaxy Trucker: The Big Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2007, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 28982, "average": 7.41091, "bayesaverage": 7.29145, "stddev": 1.44966, "median": 0.0, "owned": 31811, "trading": 611, "wanting": 1188, "wishing": 6454, "numcomments": 5861, "numweights": 1473, "averageweight": 2.3272, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 185}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 61}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 408, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 218}, "2": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 241, "not_recommended_rating": 76}, "3": {"best_rating": 95, "recommended_rating": 258, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 330, "recommended_rating": 46, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 158}}}, "usersrated": 28982.0, "average": 7.41091, "bayesaverage": 7.29145, "stddev": 1.44966, "median": 0.0, "owned": 31811.0, "trading": 611.0, "wanting": 1188.0, "wishing": 6454.0, "numcomments": 5861.0, "numweights": 1473.0, "averageweight": 2.3272, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 185}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 61}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "39463", "name": "Cosmic Encounter", "alternative_names": ["Kosmiczne spotkania", "Rencontre Cosmique", "\u30b3\u30ba\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S8cE-Ld7XP5sVz-upKJ-Bg__thumb/img/gE--xqnuor4bft2J361zxJJGCjM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1521633.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S8cE-Ld7XP5sVz-upKJ-Bg__original/img/SUTj4d_zo6bjXVhZOACmW5gvtBw=/0x0/pic1521633.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Creatures: Aliens / Extraterrestrials", "Game: Cosmic Encounter"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Negotiation", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "implementations": ["Cosmic Encounter Duel", "Cosmic Encounter: 42nd Anniversary Edition", "Game of Thrones: The Iron Throne", "Cosmic Encounter", "Cosmic Encounter", "Cosmic Encounter"], "mechanics": ["Alliances", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Negotiation", "Prisoner's Dilemma", "Race", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Take That", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Bill Eberle", "Jack Kittredge", "Bill Norton", "Peter Olotka", "Kevin Wilson"], "artists": ["Andrew Navaro", "Ryan Barger", "Felicia Cano", "Sabe Lewellyn", "Brian Schomburg", "WiL Springer"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "Arclight", "Asterion Press", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "House of Monks"], "description": "Build a galactic empire... In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.  Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy.\n\nMany classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock.  This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more.\n\nIn Cosmic Encounter, each player is the leader of an alien race. On a player's turn, he or she becomes the offense.  The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet.  The offense draws from the destiny deck which contains colors, wilds and specials.  He or she then takes the hyperspace gate and points at one planet in the system indicated by the drawn destiny card.  The offense vs. the defenses ships are in the encounter and both sides are able to invite allies, play an encounter card as well as special cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.\n\nThe object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems, just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "288318", "name": "Cosmic Encounter: Booster Promo Alien"}, {"id": "114276", "name": "Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Alliance"}, {"id": "87507", "name": "Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Conflict"}, {"id": "153971", "name": "Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Dominion"}, {"id": "206366", "name": "Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Eons"}, {"id": "61001", "name": "Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Incursion"}, {"id": "143760", "name": "Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Storm"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2008, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 26969, "average": 7.54, "bayesaverage": 7.37567, "stddev": 1.7027, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33286, "trading": 632, "wanting": 1195, "wishing": 7677, "numcomments": 5600, "numweights": 1279, "averageweight": 2.5715, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 142}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 57}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 131}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 579, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 396}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 407}, "3": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 164, "not_recommended_rating": 289}, "4": {"best_rating": 142, "recommended_rating": 346, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "5": {"best_rating": 442, "recommended_rating": 105, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5+": {"best_rating": 146, "recommended_rating": 179, "not_recommended_rating": 86}}}, "usersrated": 26969.0, "average": 7.54, "bayesaverage": 7.37567, "stddev": 1.7027, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33286.0, "trading": 632.0, "wanting": 1195.0, "wishing": 7677.0, "numcomments": 5600.0, "numweights": 1279.0, "averageweight": 2.5715, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 142}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 57}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 131}], "game_family": "Cosmic Encounter", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "219513", "name": "B\u00e4renpark", "alternative_names": ["Berenpark", "Osopark", "Park Nied\u017awiedzi", "\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a", "\u30af\u30de\u7267\u5834", "\u718a\u718a\u516c\u5712   B\u00e4renpark", "\ubca0\ub7f0\ud30c\ud06c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9JC16l1EMwmJkpbjaUBkpw__thumb/img/MbjH6nLmJQ5IjCgeULOjMfOf-NA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3486218.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9JC16l1EMwmJkpbjaUBkpw__original/img/AGuL3E65YukIgSaclMVs6UmItQM=/0x0/pic3486218.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Bears", "Animals: Koalas", "Animals: Pandas", "Components: Polyominoes"], "categories": ["Animals", "Puzzle"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Grid Coverage", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Phil Walker-Harding"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz"], "publishers": ["Lookout Games", "999 Games", "Funforge", "GaGa Games", "GoKids \u73a9\u6a02\u5c0f\u5b50", "Hobby Japan", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lacerta", "Lanlalen", "Ludofy Creative", "Maldito Games", "Mayfair Games", "uplay.it edizioni"], "description": "Up to two thousand pounds in weight and over ten feet tall, the bear is considered the biggest and heaviest terrestrial carnivore in the world. Of course, there is not just \"one bear;\" on the contrary, there are plenty of subspecies that differ from each other in various aspects. For instance, only the Kodiak bear (ursus arctos middendorffi) weighs about 2,000 lbs. The polar bear (ursus maritimus) weighs \"only\" 1,100 lbs., but gets much bigger than the Kodiak bear, being as much as 11 ft. tall!\n\nB\u00e4renpark takes you into the world of bears, challenging you to build your own bear park. Would you like another polar bear enclosure or rather a koala* house? The park visitors are sure to get hungry on their tour through the park, so build them places to eat! Whatever your choices are, make sure you get the next building permit and use your land wisely! (* No, koalas aren't bears but they're so cute, we couldn't leave them out of this game!)\n\nIn more detail, each player in B\u00e4renpark builds their own bear park, attempting to make it as beautiful as they can, while also using every square meter possible. The park is created by combining polyomino tiles onto a grid, with players scoring for animal houses, outdoor areas, completed construction, and more. The sooner you build it, the better! Cover icons to get new tiles and park sections.

Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.\n\nEvolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules.  The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.  Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.  Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.  Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:\n\n\n     Leadership: Be the leader \u2014 i.e., have more clan figures than any other player \u2014 of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.\n     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.\n     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.\n\n\nOver the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.\n\nAt the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect \"epic tales\" cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.\n\nCareful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.\n\nWhile Inis has \"dudes\" that are \"on a map\", it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "255588", "name": "Inis: Seasons of Inis"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 12097, "average": 7.79516, "bayesaverage": 7.47064, "stddev": 1.481, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15573, "trading": 196, "wanting": 1261, "wishing": 6621, "numcomments": 2071, "numweights": 323, "averageweight": 2.8854, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 108}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 87}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 275, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 165}, "2": {"best_rating": 58, "recommended_rating": 120, "not_recommended_rating": 43}, "3": {"best_rating": 91, "recommended_rating": 145, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4": {"best_rating": 154, "recommended_rating": 75, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 111}}}, "usersrated": 12097.0, "average": 7.79516, "bayesaverage": 7.47064, "stddev": 1.481, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15573.0, "trading": 196.0, "wanting": 1261.0, "wishing": 6621.0, "numcomments": 2071.0, "numweights": 323.0, "averageweight": 2.8854, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 108}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 87}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "155987", "name": "Abyss", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O9nPs9wrCghDF4izqFtoGQ__thumb/img/v2bPSjIYCfD7ekFGQswrRLwkonY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1965255.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O9nPs9wrCghDF4izqFtoGQ__original/img/QZD3-w6S6hbAQO7AfTFc342WsqI=/0x0/pic1965255.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Official Music Soundtrack", "Game: Abyss (Bombyx)", "Theme: Nature", "Theme: Under the Sea"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Mythology", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": ["Conspiracy: Abyss Universe"], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Push Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Bruno Cathala", "Charles Chevallier"], "artists": ["Xavier Collette"], "publishers": ["Bombyx", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Do it games", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "The Abyss power is once again vacant, so the time has come to get your hands on the throne and its privileges.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s\u00e9ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.\n\nUnable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.\n\nIn Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.\n\nEach hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.\n\nAfter time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.\n\nIf one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.\n\nMediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards \u2014 one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon \u2014 then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.\n\nIf a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "204573", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016"}, {"id": "231506", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017"}, {"id": "259717", "name": "Mysterium: Blue Jay"}, {"id": "213223", "name": "Mysterium: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016 Promo"}, {"id": "234156", "name": "Mysterium: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017 Promo"}, {"id": "214735", "name": "Mysterium: Game Day 2016 Promo Card"}, {"id": "192661", "name": "Mysterium: Hidden Signs"}, {"id": "282537", "name": "Mysterium: Potions"}, {"id": "186293", "name": "Mysterium: Promo Cards"}, {"id": "216465", "name": "Mysterium: Secrets & Lies"}, {"id": "202669", "name": "Mysterium: The Meeple"}, {"id": "179656", "name": "Tajemnicze Domostwo: Motive cards"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 42, "minplaytime": 42, "maxplaytime": 42, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 30900, "average": 7.31523, "bayesaverage": 7.17911, "stddev": 1.37512, "median": 0.0, "owned": 46798, "trading": 687, "wanting": 680, "wishing": 6405, "numcomments": 4391, "numweights": 689, "averageweight": 1.9057, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 243}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 87}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 46}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 324, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 229}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 197}, "3": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 127, "not_recommended_rating": 108}, "4": {"best_rating": 71, "recommended_rating": 190, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "5": {"best_rating": 202, "recommended_rating": 74, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6": {"best_rating": 153, "recommended_rating": 95, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "7": {"best_rating": 82, "recommended_rating": 116, "not_recommended_rating": 39}, "7+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 156}}}, "usersrated": 30900.0, "average": 7.31523, "bayesaverage": 7.17911, "stddev": 1.37512, "median": 0.0, "owned": 46798.0, "trading": 687.0, "wanting": 680.0, "wishing": 6405.0, "numcomments": 4391.0, "numweights": 689.0, "averageweight": 1.9057, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 243}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 87}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 46}], "game_family": "Mysterium", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 12, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "180263", "name": "The 7th Continent", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OYne8uBCHv5oEgRfpOrV0A__thumb/img/_YPdmxegKIoZI_ButuMJzfw9UBo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2648303.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OYne8uBCHv5oEgRfpOrV0A__original/img/iQDBaRJ2LxJba_M7gPZj24eHwBc=/0x0/pic2648303.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Components: Official Music Soundtrack", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: The 7th Continent"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Exploration", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": ["The 7th Citadel", "The 7th Continent: Classic Edition"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Map Addition", "Modular Board", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Ludovic Roudy", "Bruno Sautter"], "artists": ["Ludovic Roudy"], "publishers": ["Serious Poulp", "Pegasus Spiele"], "description": "It's the early 20th century.

You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:\n\n\n    Build an industry tile\n    Build a rail or canal\n    Develop an industry\n    Sell cotton\n    Take a loan\n\n\nAt the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.\n\nAfter all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.\n\nThe cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).\n\nBrass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:\n\n\n     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.\n     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.\n     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.\n     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "201381", "name": "Brass: 2-player board"}, {"id": "138329", "name": "Catalonia (fan expansion for Brass)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2007, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 18876, "average": 8.17083, "bayesaverage": 7.95907, "stddev": 1.37516, "median": 0.0, "owned": 24666, "trading": 477, "wanting": 945, "wishing": 5074, "numcomments": 4258, "numweights": 1436, "averageweight": 3.8635, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 19}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 14}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 491, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 228}, "2": {"best_rating": 45, "recommended_rating": 179, "not_recommended_rating": 114}, "3": {"best_rating": 183, "recommended_rating": 227, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "4": {"best_rating": 327, "recommended_rating": 100, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 194}}}, "usersrated": 18876.0, "average": 8.17083, "bayesaverage": 7.95907, "stddev": 1.37516, "median": 0.0, "owned": 24666.0, "trading": 477.0, "wanting": 945.0, "wishing": 5074.0, "numcomments": 4258.0, "numweights": 1436.0, "averageweight": 3.8635, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 19}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 14}], "game_family": "Brass", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "82222", "name": "Xia: Legends of a Drift System", "alternative_names": ["Xia: Leyendas de un Sistema a la Deriva", "\u041a\u0441\u0438\u0430. \u0422\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0444\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6uEBiPxMH8gfGJ6f3HLNGg__thumb/img/F_7LgdP3BKQVdrYHfIAoMu12G8c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1807124.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6uEBiPxMH8gfGJ6f3HLNGg__original/img/2sw3pLQ1eo9wpGLIbCQMOCb-XKA=/0x0/pic1807124.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Interplanetary or Interstellar scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Components: Polyhedral (not D6) dice", "Components: Polyominoes", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Crowdfunding: Verkami", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fighting", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Transportation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Map Addition", "Modular Board", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Cody Miller"], "artists": ["Cody Miller", "Steve \"Coolhand\" Tyler", "Peter Wocken"], "publishers": ["Far Off Games", "Lavka Games", "Maldito Games"], "description": "Xia: Legends of a Drift System is a 3-5 player sandbox style competitive space adventure.

Navigating hazardous environments, players choose to mine, salvage, or trade valuable cargo. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches, and most importantly Fame.\n\nThe most adaptive, risk taking, and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above the others, surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!\n\nCustomize: Each player begins the game by choosing and customizing a Tier 1 starship. Invest all your money in engines and be a rapid, yet fragile, explorer. Put all your credits into an uber missile and watch other players flee in terror. Get a small engine and save space and credits to invest in buying and selling cargo. Or create a well rounded ship, ready for anything. In Xia, the choice is always yours.\n\nAdapt: The goal of Xia is to become the most famous captain. Completing missions, besting ships in combat, purchasing higher tier ships, selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings, making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet, you'll do well in Xia!\n\nSandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play, players may choose to be peaceful traders, fierce pirates, workers, miners, opportunists, etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play.

This is your opportunity to turn your little caf\u00e9 into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your caf\u00e9 become the Grand Austria Hotel.\n\nThe start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.\n\nBut no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.\n\nWith 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value.

Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!\n\nNations is an intense historical board game for 1\u20135 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.\n\nGameplay introduction\n\nPlayers choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:\n\n\n     Buy a card\n     Deploy a worker\n     Hire an architect for a wonder\n     Special action provided by a card\n\n\nPlayers each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.\n\nWhen all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.\n\nVictory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points is the winner.\n\nSee 'More information' below for link to rules, etc.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "180539", "name": "Nations: Dynasties"}, {"id": "149247", "name": "Nations: Grand Duchy of Finland promo card"}, {"id": "149246", "name": "Nations: Hagia Sophia promo card"}, {"id": "164875", "name": "Nations: Inspiration Promo Pack"}, {"id": "149248", "name": "Nations: Kremlin promo card"}, {"id": "149249", "name": "Nations: Mechanical Turk promo card"}, {"id": "149245", "name": "Nations: Nicola Tesla promo card"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 200, "minplaytime": 40, "maxplaytime": 200, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 11022, "average": 7.64064, "bayesaverage": 7.36795, "stddev": 1.40678, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11943, "trading": 298, "wanting": 691, "wishing": 3331, "numcomments": 2089, "numweights": 672, "averageweight": 3.5357, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 144}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 102}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 260, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 87, "not_recommended_rating": 53}, "2": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 117, "not_recommended_rating": 41}, "3": {"best_rating": 126, "recommended_rating": 71, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 98, "recommended_rating": 87, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "5": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 69, "not_recommended_rating": 85}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 83}}}, "usersrated": 11022.0, "average": 7.64064, "bayesaverage": 7.36795, "stddev": 1.40678, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11943.0, "trading": 298.0, "wanting": 691.0, "wishing": 3331.0, "numcomments": 2089.0, "numweights": 672.0, "averageweight": 3.5357, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 144}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 102}], "game_family": "Nations", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "126163", "name": "Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar", "alternative_names": ["Tzolk'in: Calendarul Maia\u0219", "Tzolk'in: De Kalender van de Maya's", "Tzolk'in: Der Maya-Kalender", "Tzolk'in: El Calendario Maya", "Tzolk'in: Il Calendario Maya", "Tzolk'in: Kalendarz Maj\u00f3w", "Tzolk'in: le calendrier maya", "Tzolk'in: Maysk\u00fd kalend\u00e1\u0159", "Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar", "\u0426\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043d: \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044c \u041c\u0430\u0439\u0430", "\u0426\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043d: \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044c \u041c\u0430\u0439\u044f", "\u30c4\u30a9\u30eb\u30ad\u30f3\uff1a\u30de\u30e4\u795e\u8056\u6b74", "\u5353\u723e\u91d1\u66c6:\u99ac\u96c5\u66c6\u6cd5", "\u5353\u723e\u91d1\u6b77\uff1a\u746a\u96c5\u65e5\u66c6", "\ucd10\ud0a8: \ub9c8\uc57c\uc758 \ub2ec\ub825"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qM0qZaiTHOutr9cZZLqA1g__thumb/img/cxp5kqI0KggD9uJwWseBJj2zyZE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1413480.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qM0qZaiTHOutr9cZZLqA1g__original/img/b_3SHZiUpcmrIT5hU8wVF0SDX8k=/0x0/pic1413480.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Gears", "Country: Mexico", "Game: Tzolk'in \u2013 The Mayan Calendar", "Theme: Mayans", "Theme: Native Americans / First Peoples", "Theme: Tropical"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Civilization", "Economic", "Farming", "Mythology"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Bias", "End Game Bonuses", "Turn Order: Claim Action", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Simone Luciani", "Daniele Tascini"], "artists": ["Milan Vavro\u0148"], "publishers": ["Czech Games Edition", "Cranio Creations", "Devir", "DiceTree Games", "GaGa Games", "The Game Master BV", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby Japan", "IELLO", "Lex Games", "MINDOK", "One Moment Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Rio Grande Games", "Zacatrus"], "description": "Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker placement.

The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game.\n\nPlayers need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause.\n\nThe goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations.\n\nThrough careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "145602", "name": "Freedom: The Underground Railroad \u2013 Promo Cards"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 3814, "average": 7.59441, "bayesaverage": 6.99151, "stddev": 1.22682, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6060, "trading": 126, "wanting": 728, "wishing": 2582, "numcomments": 1054, "numweights": 187, "averageweight": 2.9091, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 389}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 73}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 225}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 82, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 41, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "2": {"best_rating": 23, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3": {"best_rating": 28, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 19, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 29}}}, "usersrated": 3814.0, "average": 7.59441, "bayesaverage": 6.99151, "stddev": 1.22682, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6060.0, "trading": 126.0, "wanting": 728.0, "wishing": 2582.0, "numcomments": 1054.0, "numweights": 187.0, "averageweight": 2.9091, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 389}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 73}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 225}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "119890", "name": "Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small", "alternative_names": ["Agricola: 2 Spelers", "Agricola: Animales en la Granja", "Agricola: Ch\u0142opi i ich zwierzyniec", "Agricola: Die Bauern und das liebe Vieh", "Agricola: Terres d'\u00c9levage", "Agricola: Tutte le Creature Grandi e Piccole", "\u30a2\u30b0\u30ea\u30b3\u30e9\uff1a\u7267\u5834\u306e\u52d5\u7269\u305f\u3061", "\u8fb2\u5bb6\u6a02\uff1a\u8fb2\u592b\u8207\u5bf5\u755c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iaxdcb_l3F8McwzyoiiCig__thumb/img/UWsWeuOQpGv5asAoyrKgwL3pVj0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1514252.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iaxdcb_l3F8McwzyoiiCig__original/img/jeB8MXXENLZyEfwdcM5yD6OmUYw=/0x0/pic1514252.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Cattle / Cows", "Animals: Horses", "Animals: Pigs", "Animals: Sheep", "Game: Agricola", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Series: Fur Zwei Spieler (Lookout Games)", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg)", "Versions & Editions: Two-Player Versions of More-Player Games"], "categories": ["Animals", "Farming"], "implementations": ["Agricola"], "mechanics": ["Automatic Resource Growth", "Enclosure", "Tile Placement", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz"], "publishers": ["Lookout Games", "999 Games", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Giochi Uniti", "Hobby Japan", "HomoLudicus", "Lacerta", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is a new take on Uwe Rosenberg's Agricola designed for exactly two players and focused only on the animal husbandry aspect of that game.

Sixteen possible actions are available for players to take, with each player taking three actions total in each of the eight rounds.\n\nThe player who amasses the most victory points through enclosing space with fences and acquiring the largest number and variety of animals and victory point-generating buildings will be the winner.\n\nFour Standard Buildings and 4 special buildings are available in the base game.

As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. Players need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times, and rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?\n\nThe aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing various buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's cathedral. Throughout the game, players need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhanded deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished.

working together as a team to find all of your agents. (Why you don't already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!)\n\nTo set up play, lay out 25 word cards in a 5\u00d75 grid. Place a key card in the holder so that each player sees one side of the card. Each player sees a 5\u00d75 grid on the card, with nine of the squares colored green (representing your agents) and three squares colored black (representing assassins). Three of the nine squares on each side are also green on the other side, one assassin is black on both sides, one is green on the other side and the other is an innocent bystander on the other side.\n\nCollectively, you need to reveal all fifteen agents \u2014 without revealing an assassin \u2014 before time runs out in order to win the game. Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player, along with a number. Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent. If correct, they can attempt to identify another one. If they identify a bystander, then their guessing time ends. If they identify an assassin, you both lose! Unlike regular Codenames, they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier. After the first clue is given, players alternate giving clues.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "213294", "name": "Codenames: Authors & Games"}, {"id": "224198", "name": "Codenames: Bonus Pack \u2013 Board

An alien frontier awaits the brave and daring!  This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.\n\nAlien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.\n\nThe game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system\u2019s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.\n\nThe planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.\n\nWinning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?\n\nRoll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!  Don't dream it'll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "258319", "name": "Alien Frontiers Factions: Definitive Edition"}, {"id": "161118", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Expansion Pack #1"}, {"id": "161120", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Expansion Pack #2"}, {"id": "161121", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Expansion Pack #3"}, {"id": "161122", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Expansion Pack #4"}, {"id": "161123", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Expansion Pack #5"}, {"id": "161124", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Expansion Pack #6"}, {"id": "171857", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Expansion Pack #7"}, {"id": "107407", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Faction Pack #1"}, {"id": "142647", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Faction Pack #2"}, {"id": "142648", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Faction Pack #3"}, {"id": "142649", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Faction Pack #4"}, {"id": "93193", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Factions"}, {"id": "174929", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Galactic Pack"}, {"id": "258320", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Mercury's Angels Faction"}, {"id": "70647", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Outer Belt"}, {"id": "218518", "name": "Alien Frontiers: Promo Pack 2017"}, {"id": "88282", "name": "Alien Frontiers: The Mind Control Helmet"}, {"id": "85964", "name": "Alien Frontiers: The Space Crane"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 14017, "average": 7.41371, "bayesaverage": 7.21192, "stddev": 1.31161, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14497, "trading": 416, "wanting": 872, "wishing": 3926, "numcomments": 3493, "numweights": 834, "averageweight": 2.5719, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 227}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 161}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 294, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 148}, "2": {"best_rating": 25, "recommended_rating": 137, "not_recommended_rating": 85}, "3": {"best_rating": 140, "recommended_rating": 109, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 134, "recommended_rating": 79, "not_recommended_rating": 35}, "4+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 131}}}, "usersrated": 14017.0, "average": 7.41371, "bayesaverage": 7.21192, "stddev": 1.31161, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14497.0, "trading": 416.0, "wanting": 872.0, "wishing": 3926.0, "numcomments": 3493.0, "numweights": 834.0, "averageweight": 2.5719, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 227}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 161}], "game_family": "Alien Frontiers", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 19, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "164928", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans", "alternative_names": ["Orlean", "\u041e\u0440\u043b\u0435\u0430\u043d", "\u30aa\u30eb\u30ec\u30a2\u30f3", "\u5967\u723e\u826f", "\uc624\ub97c\ub808\uc559"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SvbrhIAoQZ-1MyDa_v0AqQ__thumb/img/4QpksReeFqRlqXCwlG18asSivTU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2578828.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SvbrhIAoQZ-1MyDa_v0AqQ__original/img/RLjWKyzXimMFiQOa8uwo9ZWWOGM=/0x0/pic2578828.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: Orl\u00e9ans (France)", "Country: France", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Crowdfunding: Wspieram", "Game: Orl\u00e9ans", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play"], "categories": ["Medieval", "Religious", "Travel"], "implementations": ["Orl\u00e9ans Stories"], "mechanics": ["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Point to Point Movement", "Turn Order: Progressive"], "designers": ["Reiner Stockhausen"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz"], "publishers": ["dlp games", "Angry Lion Games", "Arclight", "Arrakis Games", "Baldar", "Cranio Creations", "GaGa Games", "Matagot", "MeepleBR", "Surfin' Meeple China", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Tasty Minstrel Games", "White Goblin Games"], "description": "During the medieval goings-on around Orl\u00e9ans, you must assemble a following of farmers, merchants, knights, monks, etc. to gain supremacy through trade, construction and science in medieval France.\n\nIn the city of Orl\u00e9ans and the area of the Loire, you can take trade trips to other cities to acquire coveted goods and build trading posts.

The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "317189", "name": "Meeple BR Jogos Promo Pack #1"}, {"id": "289400", "name": "Orlean: Zagroda"}, {"id": "231964", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: 5th Player Box"}, {"id": "189623", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Christmas Market"}, {"id": "186236", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Die Reise nach Tours"}, {"id": "231405", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Drawbridge"}, {"id": "307822", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Est\u00e1tua"}, {"id": "190049", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Fan-Kit"}, {"id": "286020", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Gaming Room"}, {"id": "183682", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Invasion"}, {"id": "247797", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: L'\u00e9v\u00each\u00e9 de Tours"}, {"id": "179417", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Neue Ortskarten N\u00b01"}, {"id": "184018", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Neue Ortskarten N\u00b02"}, {"id": "185922", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Neue Ortskarten N\u00b03"}, {"id": "211082", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Neue Ortskarten N\u00b04"}, {"id": "237163", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Neue Ortskarten N\u00b05"}, {"id": "234593", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Opera"}, {"id": "210145", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Prairie"}, {"id": "237167", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Promo Ortskarten N\u00b01"}, {"id": "249576", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Promo Ortskarten N\u00b02"}, {"id": "307008", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Promo Ortskarten N\u00b03"}, {"id": "166842", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Tavern & Depot"}, {"id": "204814", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Trade & Intrigue"}, {"id": "175844", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: Weinberge"}, {"id": "309312", "name": "Orl\u00e9ans: \u0421\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 21376, "average": 8.08055, "bayesaverage": 7.88744, "stddev": 1.16436, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25802, "trading": 227, "wanting": 1343, "wishing": 6629, "numcomments": 3261, "numweights": 746, "averageweight": 3.0496, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 24}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 19}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 258, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 113}, "2": {"best_rating": 29, "recommended_rating": 150, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "3": {"best_rating": 74, "recommended_rating": 119, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 142, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "4+": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 83}}}, "usersrated": 21376.0, "average": 8.08055, "bayesaverage": 7.88744, "stddev": 1.16436, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25802.0, "trading": 227.0, "wanting": 1343.0, "wishing": 6629.0, "numcomments": 3261.0, "numweights": 746.0, "averageweight": 3.0496, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 24}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 19}], "game_family": "Orl\u00e9ans", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 26, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "70149", "name": "Ora et Labora", "alternative_names": ["M\u00f3dl si\u0119 i pracuj", "Ora & Labora", "\u7948\u308a\u3001\u50cd\u3051", "\u7948\u79b1\u8207\u5de5\u4f5c", "\uae30\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ud558\ub77c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MLvyN4VJ3QNXBKxli8XLiA__thumb/img/mvTvon7ry-QKtYenVgg0LYUtdRc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5089618.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MLvyN4VJ3QNXBKxli8XLiA__original/img/3XYxG8WWhpy26GjM1gosg4K8gUY=/0x0/pic5089618.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: France", "Country: Ireland", "Food & Drink: Beer", "Food & Drink: Wine", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg)"], "categories": ["City Building", "Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Medieval", "Religious", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Modular Board", "Network and Route Building", "Worker Placement", "Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz"], "publishers": ["Lookout Games", "999 Games", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Game Harbor", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby Japan", "HomoLudicus", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lacerta", "uplay.it edizioni", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "In Ora et Labora, each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings \u2013 little enterprises that will gain resources and profit. The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items \u2013 such as books, ceramics, ornaments, and relics \u2013 to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.\n\nOra et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg's fifth \"big\" game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.\n\nEach player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.\n\nPlayers also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player's buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.\n\nOra et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "111193", "name": "Ora et Labora: Loamy Landscape"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 9667, "average": 7.7058, "bayesaverage": 7.39444, "stddev": 1.36617, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12102, "trading": 224, "wanting": 1020, "wishing": 3565, "numcomments": 1842, "numweights": 633, "averageweight": 3.9084, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 134}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 89}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 185, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 63, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "2": {"best_rating": 39, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "3": {"best_rating": 113, "recommended_rating": 40, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 83, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 72}}}, "usersrated": 9667.0, "average": 7.7058, "bayesaverage": 7.39444, "stddev": 1.36617, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12102.0, "trading": 224.0, "wanting": 1020.0, "wishing": 3565.0, "numcomments": 1842.0, "numweights": 633.0, "averageweight": 3.9084, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 134}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 89}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "70323", "name": "King of Tokyo", "alternative_names": ["King of Tokyo \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u0648\u0643\u064a\u0648", "King of Tokyo: La Furia dei Mostri", "Potwory w Tokio", "Regele din Tokyo", "O Rei de T\u00f3quio", "Toki\u00f3 Kir\u00e1lya", "Toki\u00f3 Kir\u00e1lya", "Vl\u00e1dce Tokia", "\u039f \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c5\u03bf", "\u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u0422\u043e\u043a\u0456\u043e", "\u041a\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0422\u043e\u043a\u0438\u043e", "\u041f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0422\u043e\u043a\u0438\u043e", "\u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d8\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05d5", "\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e42\u0e15\u0e40\u0e01\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27", "\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30c8\u30fc\u30ad\u30e7\u30fc", "\u6771\u4eac\u4e4b\u738b", "\u6771\u4eac\u4e4b\u738b", "\ud0b9 \uc624\ube0c \ub3c4\ucfc4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_RzXpHURC0_xLkvRSR_sw__thumb/img/OfgWmkGJj5BgOO0zFHEtP5CHfbU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3043734.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_RzXpHURC0_xLkvRSR_sw__original/img/ajEqmO5djVibsC72Ek1citOCJNA=/0x0/pic3043734.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: Tokyo (Japan)", "Components: Dice with Icons", "Country: Japan", "Creatures: Monsters", "Game: King of Tokyo", "Theme: Kaiju"], "categories": ["Dice", "Fighting", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": ["King of New York", "King of Tokyo: Dark Edition"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "King of the Hill", "Player Elimination", "Push Your Luck", "Re-rolling and Locking"], "designers": ["Richard Garfield"], "artists": ["Gabriel Butik", "Romain Gaschet", "Jonathan Silvestre", "Igor Polouchine", "Benjamin Raynal", "Jean-Baptiste Reynaud", "R\u00e9gis Torres", "Anthony Wolff"], "publishers": ["IELLO", "Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)", "Boardgame Space", "Bureau de Juegos", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Devir", "Egmont Polska", "Fantasmagoria", "GaGa Games", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "GeGe Co.

During each mission, it is not the amount of tricks, but the right tricks at the right time that count.\n\nThe team completes a mission only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks.\n\nThe game comes with 50 missions, with three additional missions published in spielbox 2/2020.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "307204", "name": "The Crew: Flight to the ISS"}, {"id": "311184", "name": "The Crew: The Deimos Adventure"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 11141, "average": 8.02773, "bayesaverage": 7.69018, "stddev": 1.22559, "median": 0.0, "owned": 23668, "trading": 141, "wanting": 475, "wishing": 4109, "numcomments": 1679, "numweights": 256, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 50}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 43}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 3}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 242, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 141}, "2": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 81}, "3": {"best_rating": 49, "recommended_rating": 119, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "4": {"best_rating": 164, "recommended_rating": 36, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 88, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 107}}}, "usersrated": 11141.0, "average": 8.02773, "bayesaverage": 7.69018, "stddev": 1.22559, "median": 0.0, "owned": 23668.0, "trading": 141.0, "wanting": 475.0, "wishing": 4109.0, "numcomments": 1679.0, "numweights": 256.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 50}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 43}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 3}], "game_family": "The Crew", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false}, {"id": "202174", "name": "Viticulture: Tuscany Essential Edition", "alternative_names": ["Viticulture: Toscane Edition Essentielle", "Viticulture: Toskania", "Viticulture: Tuscany Edici\u00f3n Esencial", "\ube44\ud2f0\uceec\uccd0: \ud22c\uc2a4\uce74\ub2c8 \uc5d0\uc13c\uc15c \uc5d0\ub514\uc158"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Xf1C1NuxY1YOHPFmpmNqiw__thumb/img/W2Gl053PiLjKXrsXZ67Y76bTPfM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3064278.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Xf1C1NuxY1YOHPFmpmNqiw__original/img/UKgKsieA-g4PGYV9tpJODaqYzTA=/0x0/pic3064278.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Viticulture", "Region: Tuscany (Italy)"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Farming"], "implementations": ["Viticulture: Tuscany \u2013 Expand the World of Viticulture"], "mechanics": ["Advantage Token", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Jamey Stegmaier", "Alan Stone"], "artists": ["Beth Sobel"], "publishers": ["Feuerland Spiele", "Ghenos Games", "Maldito Games", "Matagot", "PHALANX", "sternenschimmermeer", "Stonemaier Games"], "description": "From the publisher:\n\nTuscany Essential Edition features three expansions to Viticulture: the extended board (and 36 wooden stars), structure cards/mats, and special workers (14 meeples instead of the 66 in the original Tuscany, but gameplay is the same).

Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.\n\nEach player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.\n\nEach game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.\n\nThe ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.\n\nThe game is almost all simultaneous play.\n\nSidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 4, "maxplayers": 9, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 2228, "average": 7.80451, "bayesaverage": 6.85096, "stddev": 1.65084, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3186, "trading": 94, "wanting": 500, "wishing": 2328, "numcomments": 637, "numweights": 85, "averageweight": 3.6706, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 523}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 260}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 55, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 33}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 23}, "4": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "5": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "6": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "7": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "8": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "9": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 24, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "9+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 25}}}, "usersrated": 2228.0, "average": 7.80451, "bayesaverage": 6.85096, "stddev": 1.65084, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3186.0, "trading": 94.0, "wanting": 500.0, "wishing": 2328.0, "numcomments": 637.0, "numweights": 85.0, "averageweight": 3.6706, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 523}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 260}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": true}, {"id": "141572", "name": "Paperback", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SrygKysFHnfsy9hv9BAaAQ__thumb/img/zyHtgmAcd6vYVV7fLgvF1dHAwfk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1991455.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SrygKysFHnfsy9hv9BAaAQ__original/img/UzrdvNP-zb27P9xS_PD2IIozcLg=/0x0/pic1991455.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Theme: Books / Libraries", "Word Games: Spelling / Letters"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Print & Play", "Word Game"], "implementations": ["Hardback"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Cooperative Game", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Delayed Purchase"], "designers": ["Tim Fowers"], "artists": ["Ryan Goldsberry"], "publishers": ["Fowers Games", "(Self-Published)", "(Web published)", "Baldar", "MS Edizioni"], "description": "You are a paperback author trying to finish novels for your editor.

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.\n\nWhere the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base \u2014 all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.\n\nOne of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.\n\nThe app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.\n\nAdditionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.\n\nThe use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts.

As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.\n\nThe aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions.

The richest surviving gangster wins the game!\n\nCa$h 'n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.\n\nEach round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a \"Bang!\" or a \"Click! Click!\" card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on \"Three\" each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.\n\nEveryone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a \"Bang!\" takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table \u2014 money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a \"Bang!\" card to your hand) \u2014 until everything has been claimed.\n\nAfter eight rounds, the game ends.

Then, during Ages II and III, you can activate a god or goddess in the Pantheon instead of taking a card from the pyramid. To do so, you pay whatever that god or goddess demands from you in offerings, then place it next to your city.\n\nWith Isis on your side, you can use a card from the discard pile to construct one of your Wonders for free. Zeus, whose nod determines what happens and what does not, enables you to discard any single card from the card structure that you want, as well as any mythology or offering token that may be on it. The Phoenician goddess Tanit, whose people were renowned for trade, fills your coffers with twelve pieces of gold. Enki, the Sumerian god of crafts, technology, and creation, lets you choose one of two progress tokens. Minerva's ability to stop the conflict pawn from moving toward you can assist with a military victory or save you from military defeat.\n\nWhat's more, instead of adding three guild cards to the deck for Age III, you add three of five Grand Temples. Each Grand Temple belongs to a different Mediterranean culture, and if you possess a mythology token from that culture, you can build the temple for free. These temples are worth a total of 5, 12, or 21 points, depending on how many you build.\n\n7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon also includes two new Wonders: the Sanctuary (which gives you an additional turn and allows you to invoke deities at a reduced price) and the Divine Theater (which grants points and access to additional gods).\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [{"id": "173346", "name": "7 Wonders Duel"}], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 8478, "average": 8.02846, "bayesaverage": 7.59474, "stddev": 1.1995, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25710, "trading": 138, "wanting": 362, "wishing": 1925, "numcomments": 1598, "numweights": 128, "averageweight": 2.2734, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 69, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "2": {"best_rating": 69, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 58}}}, "usersrated": 8478.0, "average": 8.02846, "bayesaverage": 7.59474, "stddev": 1.1995, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25710.0, "trading": 138.0, "wanting": 362.0, "wishing": 1925.0, "numcomments": 1598.0, "numweights": 128.0, "averageweight": 2.2734, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "7 Wonders", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "282524", "name": "Horrified", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoClIcwjDo_iZs0idVikDw__thumb/img/YSf5Z99aBqAlNKaGBj_oGb1oKH4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4848330.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoClIcwjDo_iZs0idVikDw__original/img/oGKxUavbTR49i-P6O-WUyBfuRYs=/0x0/pic4848330.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Books: Dracula", "Characters: Frankenstein", "Creatures: Monsters", "Creatures: Werewolves", "Movies: Horror Movies", "Movies: Universal Studios Monsters", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Horror", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Setup"], "designers": ["Prospero Hall"], "artists": ["Prospero Hall"], "publishers": ["Ravensburger"], "description": "The stakes have been raised.

The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action, so players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces.\n\nThe action spaces allow a variety of actions that will score in different, but roughly equal, ways. Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points.  Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.  Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types.\n\nAll of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "144384", "name": "Tokaido: Crossroads"}, {"id": "149772", "name": "Tokaido: Eriku"}, {"id": "157816", "name": "Tokaido: Felicia Promo Card"}, {"id": "171503", "name": "Tokaido: Matsuri"}, {"id": "132479", "name": "Tokaido: The New Encounters"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 20076, "average": 6.99378, "bayesaverage": 6.83394, "stddev": 1.34718, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29379, "trading": 582, "wanting": 539, "wishing": 4314, "numcomments": 3448, "numweights": 708, "averageweight": 1.7528, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 537}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 148}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 239, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 134}, "2": {"best_rating": 29, "recommended_rating": 75, "not_recommended_rating": 84}, "3": {"best_rating": 38, "recommended_rating": 131, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "4": {"best_rating": 157, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "5": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 94, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 104}}}, "usersrated": 20076.0, "average": 6.99378, "bayesaverage": 6.83394, "stddev": 1.34718, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29379.0, "trading": 582.0, "wanting": 539.0, "wishing": 4314.0, "numcomments": 3448.0, "numweights": 708.0, "averageweight": 1.7528, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 537}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 148}], "game_family": "Tokaido", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "193037", "name": "Dead of Winter: The Long Night", "alternative_names": ["Dead of Winter: A noite sem fim", "Dead of Winter: La Larga Noche", "Dead of Winter: La Lunga Notte", "Dead of Winter: La Nuit la plus Longue", "Martwa Zima: D\u0142uga Noc", "Winter der Toten: Die lange Nacht", "Zima mrtv\u00fdch: Dlouh\u00e1 noc", "\u041c\u0451\u0440\u0442\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d: \u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c", "\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30a6\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u30ed\u30f3\u30b0\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8", "\u6b7b\u4ea1\u5bd2\u51ac\uff1a\u6f2b\u6f2b\u957f\u591c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wpWzYeX4dg5TgNdR9OsxAg__thumb/img/Pl2jzTPAUf7LI9-phQsJHL4BycE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2906832.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wpWzYeX4dg5TgNdR9OsxAg__original/img/ZLQYXI0DERFPJ1xC8PuJY__RY28=/0x0/pic2906832.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Creatures: Zombies", "Series: Crossroads (Plaid Hat Games)", "Theme: Post-Apocalyptic"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Horror", "Mature / Adult", "Science Fiction", "Zombies"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Push Your Luck", "Storytelling", "Traitor Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "designers": ["Jonathan Gilmour", "Isaac Vega"], "artists": ["Joshua Panelo", "David Richards", "Fernanda Su\u00e1rez", "Peter Wocken"], "publishers": ["Plaid Hat Games", "Arclight", "CrowD Games", "Cube Factory of Ideas", "Edge Entertainment", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Game Harbor", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "MINDOK", "Raven Distribution"], "description": "Dead of Winter: The Long Night is a standalone expansion for Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game that introduces the Raxxon location where horrible experiments will spill out into the town unless players can contain them.\n\nThe game has players at a new colony location trying to survive with new survivors against brand new challenges.

But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.\n\nWith any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.\n\nAbove and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?\n\nA great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.\n\nAt the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!\n\nThe Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:\n\n     Villager Tool tokens\n     Lost Villagers\n     Swamp Villagers\n     Exclusive Stretch goals:\n     Creature Villagers\n     Quest Tokens\n     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book\n     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book \n     Wooden Goods\n\n\n\n\nThis collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "229085", "name": "Above and Below: Desert Labyrinth and Underforest Encounter Book"}, {"id": "175452", "name": "Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives"}, {"id": "211171", "name": "Above and Below: G@mebox Building promo card"}, {"id": "213992", "name": "Above and Below: Groves"}, {"id": "258589", "name": "Above and Below: Megaland Bonus cards"}, {"id": "275731", "name": "Above and Below: Mystic's Hut Promo Card"}, {"id": "208201", "name": "Above and Below: Watch It Played Building promo card"}, {"id": "303375", "name": "Near and Far: Bounty Hunter Character Tiles"}, {"id": "264355", "name": "Near and Far: Dice Tower Character Tiles"}, {"id": "234361", "name": "Near And Far: Rodney & Pep Watch It Played Character Tiles"}, {"id": "244304", "name": "Near and Far: Secret Cabal Character Tiles"}, {"id": "274721", "name": "The Red Raven Fan Box #1"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 12510, "average": 7.43472, "bayesaverage": 7.18375, "stddev": 1.26461, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19137, "trading": 441, "wanting": 625, "wishing": 4277, "numcomments": 2463, "numweights": 349, "averageweight": 2.533, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 242}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 76}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 154, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 90}, "2": {"best_rating": 30, "recommended_rating": 94, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "3": {"best_rating": 92, "recommended_rating": 40, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 34, "recommended_rating": 84, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 77}}}, "usersrated": 12510.0, "average": 7.43472, "bayesaverage": 7.18375, "stddev": 1.26461, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19137.0, "trading": 441.0, "wanting": 625.0, "wishing": 4277.0, "numcomments": 2463.0, "numweights": 349.0, "averageweight": 2.533, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 242}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 76}], "game_family": "Above and Below", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 12, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "183251", "name": "Karuba", "alternative_names": ["\u30ab\u30eb\u30d0", "\u5361\u9b6f\u5df4", "\uce74\ub8e8\ubc14"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hhV3JiYZUHEi_glLhC0v8w__thumb/img/_XHxgYraTvLmBnHpY8snFa2ma9o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2727088.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hhV3JiYZUHEi_glLhC0v8w__original/img/Wf7ocgmPXopC2cgd48UZm4EEr8E=/0x0/pic2727088.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Series: Family Games (HABA)", "Theme: Archaeology / Paleontology", "Theme: Tropical"], "categories": ["Puzzle", "Racing"], "implementations": ["Karuba Junior", "Karuba: The Card Game"], "mechanics": ["Bingo", "Connections", "Grid Movement", "Network and Route Building", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["R\u00fcdiger Dorn"], "artists": ["Claus Stephan"], "publishers": ["Conclave Editora", "HABA", "Nabita World co., Ltd.", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "This is a tile-laying race game with players starting with boards that are identical, and one player drawing tiles that they all will use.

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\n\nThe players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n\nFortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.\n\nUsing those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.\n\nViticulture - Essential Edition comes with components for Viticulture, but adds some of the expansions from Tuscany, including 36 Mama & Papa cards, Field cards (previously known as \"Properties\"), expanded/revised Visitors, and 24 Automa cards (solo variant), along with a couple of minor rule changes.\n\nCard Totals\n\nThe Viticulture Essential Edition contains 154 cards at the 44 x 67 mm size and 88 cards at the 63 x 88 mm size.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "130655", "name": "Viticulture: Arboriculture Expansion"}, {"id": "140045", "name": "Viticulture: Kickstarter Promotional Cards"}, {"id": "193823", "name": "Viticulture: Moor Visitors Expansion"}, {"id": "202174", "name": "Viticulture: Tuscany Essential Edition"}, {"id": "248929", "name": "Viticulture: Visit from the Rhine Valley"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 27906, "average": 8.08673, "bayesaverage": 7.9099, "stddev": 1.25348, "median": 0.0, "owned": 37258, "trading": 211, "wanting": 1517, "wishing": 8717, "numcomments": 3912, "numweights": 796, "averageweight": 2.9095, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 23}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 20}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 421, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 201, "not_recommended_rating": 50}, "2": {"best_rating": 70, "recommended_rating": 239, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "3": {"best_rating": 188, "recommended_rating": 130, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 240, "recommended_rating": 88, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "5": {"best_rating": 51, "recommended_rating": 167, "not_recommended_rating": 48}, "6": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 141, "not_recommended_rating": 115}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 174}}}, "usersrated": 27906.0, "average": 8.08673, "bayesaverage": 7.9099, "stddev": 1.25348, "median": 0.0, "owned": 37258.0, "trading": 211.0, "wanting": 1517.0, "wishing": 8717.0, "numcomments": 3912.0, "numweights": 796.0, "averageweight": 2.9095, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 23}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 20}], "game_family": "Viticulture", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "146021", "name": "Eldritch Horror", "alternative_names": ["Les Contr\u00e9es de l'horreur", "Eldritch Horror: Przedwieczna Groza", "\u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0436\u0430\u0441", "\u30a8\u30eb\u30c9\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1\u30db\u30e9\u30fc", "\u5168\u7403\u9a5a\u6144", "\u5168\u7403\u9a5a\u6144", "\uc5d8\ub4dc\ub9ac\uce58 \ud638\ub7ec"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__thumb/img/I1oCwOcGxAOVx2VE2LcXuKWoLvY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1872452.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__original/img/i0zxc-H4TlTFB-yE1v4gcLy3XfY=/0x0/pic1872452.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Eldritch Horror", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Arkham Horror Files (Fantasy Flight Games)", "Theme: Cthulhu Mythos"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Horror", "Novel-based", "Travel"], "implementations": ["Arkham Horror (Third Edition)", "Arkham Horror"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Role Playing", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Stat Check Resolution", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Corey Konieczka", "Nikki Valens"], "artists": ["Anders Fin\u00e9r", "David Griffith", "Ed Mattinian", "Patrick McEvoy", "Dallas Mehlhoff", "Emilio Rodriguez", "Magali Villeneuve", "Drew Whitmore"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Arclight", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "description": "Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?\n\nEldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One \u2013 that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.\n\nWhile the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.\n\nShould you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition \u2013 or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a \"reckoning effect\" which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.\n\nAll the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.\n\nWith twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "220913", "name": "Eldritch Horror: Cities in Ruin"}, {"id": "154842", "name": "Eldritch Horror: Forsaken Lore"}, {"id": "236930", "name": "Eldritch Horror: Masks of Nyarlathotep"}, {"id": "164167", "name": "Eldritch Horror: Mountains of Madness"}, {"id": "197586", "name": "Eldritch Horror: Signs of Carcosa"}, {"id": "177182", "name": "Eldritch Horror: Strange Remnants"}, {"id": "209686", "name": "Eldritch Horror: The Dreamlands"}, {"id": "181817", "name": "Eldritch Horror: Under the Pyramids"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 240, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 240, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 28667, "average": 7.81131, "bayesaverage": 7.5809, "stddev": 1.52109, "median": 0.0, "owned": 42111, "trading": 665, "wanting": 775, "wishing": 7426, "numcomments": 4552, "numweights": 1438, "averageweight": 3.3185, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 77}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 22}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 716, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 67, "recommended_rating": 319, "not_recommended_rating": 138}, "2": {"best_rating": 141, "recommended_rating": 395, "not_recommended_rating": 56}, "3": {"best_rating": 140, "recommended_rating": 358, "not_recommended_rating": 52}, "4": {"best_rating": 469, "recommended_rating": 139, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "5": {"best_rating": 62, "recommended_rating": 267, "not_recommended_rating": 167}, "6": {"best_rating": 54, "recommended_rating": 211, "not_recommended_rating": 223}, "7": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 65, "not_recommended_rating": 396}, "8": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 63, "not_recommended_rating": 411}, "8+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 386}}}, "usersrated": 28667.0, "average": 7.81131, "bayesaverage": 7.5809, "stddev": 1.52109, "median": 0.0, "owned": 42111.0, "trading": 665.0, "wanting": 775.0, "wishing": 7426.0, "numcomments": 4552.0, "numweights": 1438.0, "averageweight": 3.3185, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 77}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 22}], "game_family": "Eldritch Horror", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "146439", "name": "BattleLore (Second Edition)", "alternative_names": ["BattleLore (Seconda Edizione)", "BattleLore (Seconde \u00c9dition)", "\u6230\u722d\u4e4b\u9053 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u7248"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CWlHT1QMeB9hXaPcjE7cyw__thumb/img/_2T1jX4xfmE5cHdewuavWuqnmhw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1854807.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CWlHT1QMeB9hXaPcjE7cyw__original/img/bQLvhHye5_qR4ohxAWRqOnADXdg=/0x0/pic1854807.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Creatures: Monsters", "Game: BattleLore", "Game: BattleLore (Second Edition)", "Game: Commands & Colors", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Setting: The Realms of Terrinoth"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "implementations": ["BattleLore"], "mechanics": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Richard Borg", "Robert A.

Why don't we start farming olives, like our neighbors?\"\n\nThe cart-driver nods: \"Ever since them city folks started worshiping San Giorgio I have to travel further and further to new building sites. I'm on my way now to the new inn they built. I'll change horses there and deliver this load,\" he gestures towards the pile of wood in the cart with his head \"to the sea beyond. Gonna start some fisheries there. It is said we'll conquer those olive-farmers before long. But their land is even more polluted than ours.\"\n\nThe farmer nods his head in reply. As the cart starts moving again, he returns to the field to harvest the last bushels of grain, growing between the stumps of what used to be a lush forest -- three turns ago.\n\nAntiquity is a strategy game for 2-4 players. It is set in an environment loosely modeled on Italy in the late Middle Ages. Players choose their own victory condition: they can focus on population growth, trade, conquest, or city building by choosing their patron saint.\n\nEach strategy requires a completely different style of play. Or you can choose to adore Santa Maria, the most powerful saint of all -- but you'll be expected to build a civilization twice as impressive as any other player.\n\nWhile your economy is constantly improving, with more and more advanced cities bringing new options each turn, the land around your cities is slowly being depleted, forcing you to travel further and further to gather your raw materials -- until finally, there is no more land left to farm.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.\n\nWhat causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.\n\nWith multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.\n For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.\n\nFrom the publisher's website:\n\nDare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "169390", "name": "La Isla Prohibida: La Expansi\u00f3n Prohibida"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 41044, "average": 6.79404, "bayesaverage": 6.70107, "stddev": 1.19976, "median": 0.0, "owned": 70726, "trading": 2001, "wanting": 218, "wishing": 3733, "numcomments": 8006, "numweights": 1994, "averageweight": 1.7417, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 709}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 214}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 422, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 165, "not_recommended_rating": 143}, "2": {"best_rating": 71, "recommended_rating": 261, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "3": {"best_rating": 122, "recommended_rating": 228, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 268, "recommended_rating": 82, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "4+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 205}}}, "usersrated": 41044.0, "average": 6.79404, "bayesaverage": 6.70107, "stddev": 1.19976, "median": 0.0, "owned": 70726.0, "trading": 2001.0, "wanting": 218.0, "wishing": 3733.0, "numcomments": 8006.0, "numweights": 1994.0, "averageweight": 1.7417, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 709}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 214}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "140620", "name": "Lewis & Clark: The Expedition", "alternative_names": ["Lewis & Clark", "Lewis & Clark: a Expedi\u00e7\u00e3o", "Lewis & Clark: Cesta na Severoz\u00e1pad", "Lewis & Clark: Die Expedition", "\ub8e8\uc774\uc2a4 \uc564 \ud074\ub77c\ud06c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IiJ1JK6AjlSCKsC8U_DqMw__thumb/img/sRsfWxhyB9hPjkFVSE1y_W_AiP8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375937.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IiJ1JK6AjlSCKsC8U_DqMw__original/img/WTRBe8gqwLZXRIL6ER65Ou3SLYQ=/0x0/pic5375937.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards", "Game: Lewis & Clark", "Historical Figures: Lewis & Clark", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Native Americans / First Peoples"], "categories": ["American West", "Racing"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Retrieval", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Race", "Resource to Move", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Track Movement", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["C\u00e9drick Chaboussit"], "artists": ["Vincent Dutrait"], "publishers": ["Ludonaute", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "EVA GAMES", "GateOnGames", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hunter & Cron", "MeepleBR", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "REXhry"], "description": "On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon.

Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.\n\nLewis & Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new \"handbuilding\" mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.\n\nSince the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "164557", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Bauza & Cathala"}, {"id": "155402", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Benjamin Bord"}, {"id": "164554", "name": "Lewis & Clark: C\u00e9drick Chaboussit"}, {"id": "164556", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Martin Wallace"}, {"id": "314494", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Promo Cards"}, {"id": "164555", "name": "Lewis & Clark: Uwe Rosenberg"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 12654, "average": 7.49439, "bayesaverage": 7.26682, "stddev": 1.29016, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14993, "trading": 399, "wanting": 636, "wishing": 3401, "numcomments": 2318, "numweights": 657, "averageweight": 3.3425, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 197}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 141}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 272, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 106, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "2": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 144, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "3": {"best_rating": 162, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 111, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "5": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 49, "not_recommended_rating": 121}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 88}}}, "usersrated": 12654.0, "average": 7.49439, "bayesaverage": 7.26682, "stddev": 1.29016, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14993.0, "trading": 399.0, "wanting": 636.0, "wishing": 3401.0, "numcomments": 2318.0, "numweights": 657.0, "averageweight": 3.3425, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 197}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 141}], "game_family": "Lewis & Clark", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "140934", "name": "Arboretum", "alternative_names": ["Arbor\u00e9tum", "\u0410\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0443\u043c", "\u6811\u6728\u56ed", "\uc218\ubaa9\uc6d0"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__thumb/img/X6V1M2nZOinTgwE0KIBfup_QrCw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4172124.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__original/img/sJFGZGYrOXrjOL5fHI-uVkpJmEU=/0x0/pic4172124.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Draw and Discard", "Series: Deluxe card game (Z-Man / Filosofia)", "Theme: Nature", "Theme: Trees and Forests"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Pattern Building", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Dan Cassar"], "artists": ["Philippe Gu\u00e9rin", "Chris Quilliams", "Beth Sobel", "Waldo Ramirez"], "publishers": ["Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Renegade Game Studios", "Z-Man Games, Inc.", "ABACUSSPIELE", "Banana Games", "Fractal Juegos", "Gen-X Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lavka Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "TLAMA games", "Vagabund"], "description": "Arboretum is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, aged 10 and up, that combines set collection, tile-laying and hand management while playing in about 25 minutes. Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.\n\nThe deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.\n\nWhen the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color. Whoever has the most points wins.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 12462, "average": 7.39952, "bayesaverage": 7.17242, "stddev": 1.21567, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21440, "trading": 311, "wanting": 644, "wishing": 3815, "numcomments": 2687, "numweights": 367, "averageweight": 2.1526, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 248}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 41}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 226, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 106}, "2": {"best_rating": 107, "recommended_rating": 84, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "3": {"best_rating": 68, "recommended_rating": 103, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 59, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 94}}}, "usersrated": 12462.0, "average": 7.39952, "bayesaverage": 7.17242, "stddev": 1.21567, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21440.0, "trading": 311.0, "wanting": 644.0, "wishing": 3815.0, "numcomments": 2687.0, "numweights": 367.0, "averageweight": 2.1526, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 248}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 41}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "46213", "name": "Telestrations", "alternative_names": ["Esquiss\u00e9?", "Huhupuheita", "Interferencias", "Passa o Desenho", "Podaj dalej!", "Ryktet G\u00e5r...", "Sig det videre", "Stille Post Extrem", "Telestrations El Original", "Wat schets je me nou?!", "\u03a3\u03ba\u03b9\u03c4\u03c3\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1", "\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0444\u043e\u043d", "\u30c6\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u50b3\u60c5\u756b\u610f", "\ud154\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oc3u6OQpJkf9TvDw4iI9xA__thumb/img/Otc-6MFf-HC9ep-82ub2B2rID78=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4991936.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oc3u6OQpJkf9TvDw4iI9xA__original/img/E8wGa46usehtN1a081shjC8B5Nk=/0x0/pic4991936.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Telestrations", "Mechanism: Drawing", "Mechanism: Give a Clue / Get a Clue"], "categories": ["Humor", "Party Game", "Real-time"], "implementations": ["Telestrations After Dark", "Telestrations: 12 Player Party Pack", "Telestrations: 6 Player Family Pack", "Telestrations: Upside Drawn"], "mechanics": ["Paper-and-Pencil"], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "artists": ["(Uncredited)"], "publishers": ["Anv\u00e4ndbart Litet F\u00f6retag", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Competo / Marektoy", "Crown & Andrews Ltd.", "Desyllas Games", "Goliath Games", "Ideal", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Magellan", "MESAboardgames", "The Op", "Randolph", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)", "WOW!

Hospitals also are a bit more powerful.\n     Historical Diseases : instead of being generic, each disease has a specific power to better represent what it is (Malaria, Cholera, Yellow Fever etc.)\n\n\n\n\nPart of the Pandemic series.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 8120, "average": 7.93326, "bayesaverage": 7.50617, "stddev": 1.18716, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14508, "trading": 181, "wanting": 412, "wishing": 2461, "numcomments": 1387, "numweights": 138, "averageweight": 2.5725, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 98}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 76}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 109, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 40, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "2": {"best_rating": 25, "recommended_rating": 69, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 40, "recommended_rating": 44, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 51, "recommended_rating": 28, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 54}}}, "usersrated": 8120.0, "average": 7.93326, "bayesaverage": 7.50617, "stddev": 1.18716, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14508.0, "trading": 181.0, "wanting": 412.0, "wishing": 2461.0, "numcomments": 1387.0, "numweights": 138.0, "averageweight": 2.5725, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 98}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 76}], "game_family": "Pandemic", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "198994", "name": "Hero Realms", "alternative_names": ["Hero Realms: Jeu de Deckbuilding", "\u0411\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BZiR636JJdSBwThtH42DVw__thumb/img/UNdB7VkSDleswj3iXhVOxVeqxxc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3744052.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BZiR636JJdSBwThtH42DVw__original/img/km-FMXpaL2mb-t5AUHa0yHjoLXA=/0x0/pic3744052.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Hero Realms"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "implementations": ["Star Realms"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Take That"], "designers": ["Robert Dougherty", "Darwin Kastle"], "artists": ["Randy Delven", "Vito Gesualdi", "Antonis Papantoniou"], "publishers": ["White Wizard Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment GmbH", "Devir", "Games Factory", "Games Factory Publishing", "Hobby World", "IELLO"], "description": "Hero Realms is a fantasy-themed deck-building game that is an adaptation of the award-winning Star Realms game. The game includes basic rules for two-player games, along with rules for multiplayer formats such as Free-For-All, Hunter, and Hydra.\n\nEach player starts the game with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). You start each turn with a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck. An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions. When you reduce your opponent's score (called health) to zero, you win!\n\nMultiple expansions are available for Hero Realms that allow players to start as a particular character (Cleric, Fighter,

Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as \"The Most Select of Places\" (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.\n\nJoin ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.\n\nThe game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.\n\nThe game takes place over multiple rounds, following this pattern:\n\n\n\n    \n         2 Rounds\n\n         \u00a0=\u00a0\n\n         1 Rotation\n\n    \n    \n         2 Rotations\n\n         \u00a0=\u00a0\n\n         1 Maat phase\n\n    \n    \n         2 Maat phases\n\n         \u00a0=\u00a0\n\n         1 Scoring\n\n    \n    \n         2 Scorings\n\n         \u00a0=\u00a0\n\n         1 Game\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nEach round, you draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. At the beginning of the game, each of the six sections contains three dice. However, as dice are drafted and eventually refilled, the different sections will contain a varying number of dice.\n\nDice come in five colors: white, yellow, black, brown, and gray. Depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow, each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.\n\nWhen drafting a die, you must consider not only the general availability of dice \u2014 if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section \u2014 but also which value die to draft and how your chosen die will affect the overall balance when the Maat phase occurs. An imbalance in favor of Purity carries no negative outcome whereas a Tainted imbalance may result in the loss of victory points. A perfect balance between Pure and Tainted dice, however, results in a more favorable turn order.\n\nAfter drafting one die and placing it on your player board (either on the Pure or Tainted side), you perform an action, the effect of which depends on the value of the die you selected.\n\nHorus\nTaking the Horus god action allows the building of statues, either in honor of one of the gods or for the people. Building a statue in honor of a god grants you benefits when other players perform actions associated with that god. Building a statue for the people grants favorable benefits during scoring.\n\nRa\nWhen taking the Ra god action, you add a pillar to the Amun-Ra temple grid, scoring victory points and gaining resources and possibly powerful bonus actions.\n\nHathor\nThe Hathor god action results in the construction of buildings around the Amun-Ra temple complex, providing rich resources and considerable influence during scoring. This action also increases the current population.\n\nBastet\nBy taking the Bastet god action, a festival takes place, increasing the happiness of the people. However, the happiness marker can never overtake the population marker, making it necessary to strike a balance between different actions. Keeping your people happy unlocks powerful one-time benefits as well as bonus victory points during scoring and more options when taking the Thoth god action.\n\nThoth\nThe game includes three types of cards: blessings, technologies, and decrees. Taking the Thoth god action allows you to gain these cards, the type of which is determined by the happiness of your people. Also, the happier your people are, the greater the selection of cards available from which you can choose.\n\nOsiris\nTaking the Osiris god action allows you to construct workshops and quarries, each of which increases your production of one of the four resources: papyrus, bread, limestone, and granite.

Additionally, after the second and final scoring, you can earn bonus victory points from various decrees you have collected during the game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "301358", "name": "Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun \u2013 Foundations of Karnak"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2020, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 1738, "average": 7.97251, "bayesaverage": 6.76785, "stddev": 1.33411, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3712, "trading": 22, "wanting": 331, "wishing": 2024, "numcomments": 333, "numweights": 177, "averageweight": 3.9831, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 622}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 286}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 70, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "2": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "3": {"best_rating": 34, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 17}}}, "usersrated": 1738.0, "average": 7.97251, "bayesaverage": 6.76785, "stddev": 1.33411, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3712.0, "trading": 22.0, "wanting": 331.0, "wishing": 2024.0, "numcomments": 333.0, "numweights": 177.0, "averageweight": 3.9831, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 622}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 286}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "15512", "name": "Diamant", "alternative_names": ["Diamantes", "Diamenty", "Diamond", "Gy\u00e9m\u00e1ntvad\u00e1szok", "Incan Gold", "Tesouro Inca", "\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e15\u0e34\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e04\u0e32", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30ab\u306e\u9ec4\u91d1", "\u5370\u52a0\u5bf6\u85cf", "\uc789\uce74\uc758 \ud669\uae08"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_DWv97HbQ_hNeCM_Tcp2XQ__thumb/img/RaIiC1TR0_Emlz3n5EKi_WowcgQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3581963.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_DWv97HbQ_hNeCM_Tcp2XQ__original/img/Re3G42C1pfWaS_MnXwHr4TnM3NU=/0x0/pic3581963.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Peru", "Series: Bookshelf (Gryphon Games)", "Theme: Archaeology / Paleontology"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Bluffing", "Exploration"], "implementations": ["Tens\u00e3o Total"], "mechanics": ["Move Through Deck", "Push Your Luck", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "designers": ["Bruno Faidutti", "Alan R.

Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.\n\nWhy would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper \u2014 but at the risk of ending up with nothing.\n\nAll editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2005, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 16723, "average": 6.82619, "bayesaverage": 6.70143, "stddev": 1.20074, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20644, "trading": 322, "wanting": 677, "wishing": 3221, "numcomments": 5213, "numweights": 800, "averageweight": 1.1125, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 708}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 193}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 178, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 121}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 115}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 65, "not_recommended_rating": 76}, "4": {"best_rating": 23, "recommended_rating": 112, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "5": {"best_rating": 67, "recommended_rating": 86, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "6": {"best_rating": 110, "recommended_rating": 40, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "7": {"best_rating": 99, "recommended_rating": 44, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "8": {"best_rating": 95, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "8+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 65}}}, "usersrated": 16723.0, "average": 6.82619, "bayesaverage": 6.70143, "stddev": 1.20074, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20644.0, "trading": 322.0, "wanting": 677.0, "wishing": 3221.0, "numcomments": 5213.0, "numweights": 800.0, "averageweight": 1.1125, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 708}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 193}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "15987", "name": "Arkham Horror", "alternative_names": ["Horreur \u00e0 Arkham", "Horror w Arkham", "Retteg\u00e9s Arkhamban", "\u0423\u0436\u0430\u0441 \u0410\u0440\u043a\u0445\u044d\u043c\u0430", "\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30e0\u30db\u30e9\u30fc", "\u9b54\u9547\u60ca\u9b42 (\u9b54\u93ae\u9a5a\u9b42 )", "\uc544\ucef4 \ud638\ub7ec"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9cJf4kd_HZQo6NunfJlo9w__thumb/img/6VzhMMmGOxNTCHQ-8iFdn5vINis=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic175966.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9cJf4kd_HZQo6NunfJlo9w__original/img/oArWMFiDP2tYbJvCY52jeLwlCyU=/0x0/pic175966.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Arkham Horror", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Arkham Horror Files (Fantasy Flight Games)", "Theme: Cthulhu Mythos"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Horror", "Novel-based"], "implementations": ["Arkham Horror (Third Edition)", "Eldritch Horror", "Arkham Horror"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Role Playing", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Stat Check Resolution", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Richard Launius", "Kevin Wilson"], "artists": ["Anders Fin\u00e9r", "Rafa\u0142 Hrynkiewicz", "Richard Launius", "Henning Ludvigsen", "Patrick McEvoy", "Kurt Miller", "Scott Nicely", "Vlad Ricean", "Brian Schomburg", "Kevin Wilson"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Arclight", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Nexus Editrice", "Smart Ltd", "Ubik", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "description": "\n        The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties.

At the end of 8 rounds of play, the player who has accrued the most points wins the game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "122996", "name": "Lords of Waterdeep: Inevitable Betrayal Promo Card"}, {"id": "146704", "name": "Lords of Waterdeep: Rapid Expansion Promo Card"}, {"id": "134342", "name": "Lords of Waterdeep: Scoundrels of Skullport"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 45004, "average": 7.75314, "bayesaverage": 7.62513, "stddev": 1.2715, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54966, "trading": 607, "wanting": 1225, "wishing": 8947, "numcomments": 7642, "numweights": 2112, "averageweight": 2.4645, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 64}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 67}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 648, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 353}, "2": {"best_rating": 68, "recommended_rating": 355, "not_recommended_rating": 124}, "3": {"best_rating": 331, "recommended_rating": 236, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "4": {"best_rating": 375, "recommended_rating": 182, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "5": {"best_rating": 94, "recommended_rating": 297, "not_recommended_rating": 91}, "5+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 31, "not_recommended_rating": 255}}}, "usersrated": 45004.0, "average": 7.75314, "bayesaverage": 7.62513, "stddev": 1.2715, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54966.0, "trading": 607.0, "wanting": 1225.0, "wishing": 8947.0, "numcomments": 7642.0, "numweights": 2112.0, "averageweight": 2.4645, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 64}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 67}], "game_family": "Lords of Waterdeep", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "50381", "name": "Cards Against Humanity", "alternative_names": ["Cards Against Humanity For Her", "Cartas Controversas"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nYLrPiI9gnvlrwOrKQ4_CA__thumb/img/fIhQLjWueNPYZhCZ_LzjAIhPm5U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2909692.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nYLrPiI9gnvlrwOrKQ4_CA__original/img/jg6r3iBsIWQAIFhrcGlQ1o-ZfzQ=/0x0/pic2909692.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Cards Against Humanity (Official)", "Mechanism: Judging Games"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game", "Print & Play"], "implementations": ["Cards Against Humanity: Family Edition"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Player Judge", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "designers": ["Josh Dillon", "Daniel Dranove", "Eli Halpern", "Ben Hantoot", "David Munk", "David Pinsof", "Max Temkin", "Eliot Weinstein"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)", "Estrela"], "description": "\"A party game for horrible people.\"\n\nPlay begins with a judge, known as the \"Card Czar\", choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players.  Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an \"Awesome Point\", and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.\n\nThis, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like \"Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor\".\n\nIn addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are \"Pick 2\" or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.\n\nFrom the website:\n\n\"Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

It's known as the Savage Mountain, as it kills one person for every four who have reached the summit... Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory.\u00a0\n\nK2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team.\u00a0\nYou can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.\nK2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike.\nThe box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "105059", "name": "K2: Broad Peak"}, {"id": "257817", "name": "K2: Lhotse"}, {"id": "120600", "name": "K2: The Avalanche"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 8894, "average": 7.06739, "bayesaverage": 6.81818, "stddev": 1.23138, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9569, "trading": 219, "wanting": 609, "wishing": 2357, "numcomments": 1707, "numweights": 543, "averageweight": 2.2652, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 550}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 161}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 132}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 168, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 82, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "2": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 93, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "3": {"best_rating": 77, "recommended_rating": 43, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 70, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 22, "recommended_rating": 61, "not_recommended_rating": 19}, "5+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 58}}}, "usersrated": 8894.0, "average": 7.06739, "bayesaverage": 6.81818, "stddev": 1.23138, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9569.0, "trading": 219.0, "wanting": 609.0, "wishing": 2357.0, "numcomments": 1707.0, "numweights": 543.0, "averageweight": 2.2652, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 550}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 161}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 132}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "27162", "name": "Kingsburg", "alternative_names": ["K\u00f6nigsburg", "\u041a\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0441\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pHFQxD8va6vOrrNfazVzsg__thumb/img/C5cCKKfjEpm87frQIFOOYfzmIyc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic253057.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pHFQxD8va6vOrrNfazVzsg__original/img/hPiE4pKUmJB8kxV9dEznLEq1qg4=/0x0/pic253057.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["City Building", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Medieval"], "implementations": ["Kingsburg (Second Edition)", "Kingsburg: The Dice Game", "Kingsport Festival"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Worker Placement with Dice Workers"], "designers": ["Andrea Chiarvesio", "Luca Iennaco"], "artists": ["Mad4GameStyle"], "publishers": ["Stratelibri", "Edge Entertainment", "ElfinWerks", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "Smart Ltd", "Truant Spiele", "Ubik", "Ulisses Spiele"], "description": "In Kingsburg, players are Lords sent from the King to administer frontier territories.\n\nThe game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns.

Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.\n\nEach adviser on the King's Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn.\n\nAt the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner.\n\nMany alternate strategies are possible to win: will you go for the military way, disregarding economic and prestige buildings, or will you aim to complete the big Cathedral to please the King?   Will you use the Merchant's Guild to gain more influence in the Council, or will you go for balanced development?\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "139022", "name": "Kingsburg: Dice and Tokens (Black)"}, {"id": "139021", "name": "Kingsburg: Dice and Tokens (Blue)"}, {"id": "139020", "name": "Kingsburg: Dice and Tokens (Green)"}, {"id": "139018", "name": "Kingsburg: Dice and Tokens (Red)"}, {"id": "139019", "name": "Kingsburg: Dice and Tokens (Yellow)"}, {"id": "272224", "name": "Kingsburg: Expansion Module #6 \u2013 Alternate Advisor Rewards"}, {"id": "85446", "name": "Kingsburg: Goblin Valley"}, {"id": "85447", "name": "Kingsburg: Shifting Alliances"}, {"id": "85448", "name": "Kingsburg: The Demanding Capital"}, {"id": "39775", "name": "Kingsburg: To Forge a Realm"}, {"id": "85445", "name": "Kingsburg: Wheel and Deal"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2007, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 18207, "average": 7.19561, "bayesaverage": 7.04152, "stddev": 1.22746, "median": 0.0, "owned": 16997, "trading": 363, "wanting": 769, "wishing": 3502, "numcomments": 3848, "numweights": 1213, "averageweight": 2.4287, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 346}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 248}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 73}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 293, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 147}, "2": {"best_rating": 25, "recommended_rating": 116, "not_recommended_rating": 82}, "3": {"best_rating": 73, "recommended_rating": 157, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4": {"best_rating": 172, "recommended_rating": 76, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "5": {"best_rating": 58, "recommended_rating": 117, "not_recommended_rating": 47}, "5+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 114}}}, "usersrated": 18207.0, "average": 7.19561, "bayesaverage": 7.04152, "stddev": 1.22746, "median": 0.0, "owned": 16997.0, "trading": 363.0, "wanting": 769.0, "wishing": 3502.0, "numcomments": 3848.0, "numweights": 1213.0, "averageweight": 2.4287, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 346}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 248}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 73}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 11, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "27225", "name": "Bananagrams", "alternative_names": ["Big Letter Bananagrams", "Jumbo Bananagrams", "\u9999\u8549\u62fc\u5b57", "\ubc14\ub098\ub098\uadf8\ub7a8\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1QjYPI4bXx4OUMJPlrsNBA__thumb/img/nC_gG-4CYy7VBfYez2qSfTkU2ik=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2463443.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1QjYPI4bXx4OUMJPlrsNBA__original/img/YkEZH0195Gs84brLmF8EPEtZFl4=/0x0/pic2463443.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Food & Drink: Bananas", "Game: Bananagrams", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Word Games: Spelling / Letters"], "categories": ["Real-time", "Word Game"], "implementations": ["Bananagrams Duel!", "Bananagrams Party", "Bananagrams WildTiles", "Double Bananagrams", "My First Bananagrams"], "mechanics": ["Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Rena Nathanson", "Abe Nathanson"], "artists": ["Kendra Harrington", "Sandy Nathanson", "Aaron Nathanson"], "publishers": ["Bananagrams, Inc.", "999 Games", "AURUM, Inc.", "Br\u00e4dspel.se", "Broadway Toys LTD", "dV Giochi", "Game Factory", "KOSMOS", "L\u00fadilo", "MINDOK", "Peliko/Martinex Oy", "Trefl", "Venner\u00f8d Forlag AS"], "description": "Bananagrams is a fast and fun word game that requires no pencil, paper or board, and the tiles come in a fabric banana-shaped carrying pouch.

During the day, choose an action amongst the nine possible choices provided by your player mat and perform it immediately. Once every player has taken five actions, night falls, with players gathering Prayer Points from their temples, drawing Divine Intervention cards, and determining the turn order before the start of the new day.\n\nAs the game progresses, they can use Prayer Points to acquire power tiles. Some of these enroll magical creatures and have them join their troops. In addition to intimidating enemies, these creatures provide special powers!\n\nDetailed miniature components represent the combat units and the supernatural creatures that are summoned to enhance them.

At the end of a player's turn, if she has three hearts, she draws one Evolution card and adds it to her hand; this is possible even in Tokyo (when hearts are normally useless) and even if the hearts are used for some other action, such as healing.\n\nA player can reveal and play an Evolution card at any time. Some Evolutions are temporary, allowing a one-time bonus, while others are Permanent, such as Gigazaur's \"Tail Sweep\", which allows him to change one die to a 1 or 2 each turn. Each Evolution card also identifies whether a monster is a Mutant, Invader, or Robot, and while not relevant for Power Up!, this species identification could come into play in future expansions.\n\nThe rules for King of Tokyo: Power Up! contain a few variants: Players start with a random Evolution in play, or draw two cards and choose the one they want, or draft a set of Evolutions prior to the start of play. However you play, the goal of the game remains the same: Score 20 points or be the last monster standing amid the rubble of what was once Tokyo.\n\nPart of the King of Tokyo series.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "250532", "name": "King of Tokyo/New York: Monster Pack \u2013 Anubis"}, {"id": "207292", "name": "King of Tokyo/New York: Monster Pack \u2013 Cthulhu"}, {"id": "233076", "name": "King of Tokyo/New York: Monster Pack \u2013 King Kong"}, {"id": "292108", "name": "King of Tokyo: Frantic Mutations Promo Card"}, {"id": "147183", "name": "King of Tokyo: Halloween"}], "expands": [{"id": "70323", "name": "King of Tokyo"}], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 10262, "average": 7.62967, "bayesaverage": 7.32261, "stddev": 1.17768, "median": 0.0, "owned": 27721, "trading": 305, "wanting": 231, "wishing": 1184, "numcomments": 2212, "numweights": 351, "averageweight": 1.7009, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 60, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 41}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "3": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 18, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "6": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "6+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 26}}}, "usersrated": 10262.0, "average": 7.62967, "bayesaverage": 7.32261, "stddev": 1.17768, "median": 0.0, "owned": 27721.0, "trading": 305.0, "wanting": 231.0, "wishing": 1184.0, "numcomments": 2212.0, "numweights": 351.0, "averageweight": 1.7009, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "King of Tokyo", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "127398", "name": "Legends of Andor", "alternative_names": ["Andor", "Andor legend\u00e1i", "Andor: dobrodru\u017en\u00e9 legendy", "De Legenden van Andor", "Die Legenden von Andor", "Legendy krainy Andor", "Le Leggende di Andor", "As Lendas de Andor", "Las Leyendas de Andor", "\u0398\u03c1\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0386\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1", "\u0410\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0440", "\u041b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0440", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac", "\uc548\ub3c4\ub974\uc758 \uc804\uc124"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IO8_BYKeofnWy8DIjo2RRg__thumb/img/pMbV-KGyO3D9U6hnBzNRfylZvto=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2606106.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IO8_BYKeofnWy8DIjo2RRg__original/img/mIYkOMtGopRZ52JU0lzMq5jKO_o=/0x0/pic2606106.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Legends of Andor"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Puzzle"], "implementations": ["Andor Junior"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Michael Menzel"], "artists": ["Michaela Kienle", "Michael Menzel"], "publishers": ["KOSMOS", "999 Games", "Albi", "Arclight", "Br\u00e4dspel.se", "Devir", "Fantasmagoria", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "IELLO", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Piatnik", "Zvezda"], "description": "Legends of Andor is a cooperative adventure board game for two to four players in which a band of heroes must work together to defend a fantasy realm from invading hordes. To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.\n\nAt the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or \"Legend\", a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.\n\nWill their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm?

From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!\n\nMultiple expansions featuring different maps are available.

Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nA revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.\n\nComplete series overview -

Each player has a set of 15 \"men\" that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of his men to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's men, forcing the captured men to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 men off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the \"doubling cube\", which allows players to up the stakes of the game, as it is often played for money. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll as well as measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.\n\nBackgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920's, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.\n\nThe names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means \"Battle on Wood\". In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (\"game of twelve marks\"), later, Tabula (\"table\"), and by the sixth century, Alea (\"dice\"). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from \"Bac gamen\" meaning \"Back Game\", referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.\n\nIt was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called \"The Aristocratic Game.\" The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).\n\nThe rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930's.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "137175", "name": "Backgammon: Zombie Rush"}, {"id": "214606", "name": "Dargammon"}, {"id": "24154", "name": "Whamgammon"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": -3000, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 11456, "average": 6.53521, "bayesaverage": 6.36311, "stddev": 1.60289, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17296, "trading": 127, "wanting": 20, "wishing": 225, "numcomments": 3002, "numweights": 911, "averageweight": 2.0176, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1262}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 127}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 147, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 112}, "2": {"best_rating": 140, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 109}}}, "usersrated": 11456.0, "average": 6.53521, "bayesaverage": 6.36311, "stddev": 1.60289, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17296.0, "trading": 127.0, "wanting": 20.0, "wishing": 225.0, "numcomments": 3002.0, "numweights": 911.0, "averageweight": 2.0176, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1262}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 127}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "2452", "name": "Jenga", "alternative_names": ["Balance Tower", "Block a Block", "Bugs Building", "Classic Jenga", "Dhilema", "Hoppla Nature", "Huojuva torni", "Jenga Book Lovers Edition", "Jenga Mark II", "Jenga Nightmare Before Christmas Collector's Edition", "Jenga The Walking Dead", "Jenga: National Parks Edition", "JENGA: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas Travel Edition", "Jiggle Tower", "Jinga", "Klodsmajor", "Mini Timber Tumble", "Miombo Tumble Tower", "Plock Bygg & Ras!", "Prumo Gigante", "Red High Rise", "Stack 'em", "Stack The Carrots", "Tenka", "Tension Tower", "Terremoto", "Tilt!", "Timba!", "Timber", "Timberrr: A Game of Balance", "Torenhoog", "Torre", "Torre de Madera", "Torre Equil\u00edbrio", "Torre Pendente", "Torre Tambaleante", "Torre Treme-Treme", "Torremoto", "Tour Chancelante", "Tour folle", "Tower", "Tower Up", "Towering!

The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.\n\nOnce the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.\n\nThe game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.\n\nThe same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name \"Hoppla - eins zuviel!\"\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1983, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 6, "stats": {"usersrated": 11339, "average": 5.60143, "bayesaverage": 5.53929, "stddev": 1.45235, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19771, "trading": 169, "wanting": 13, "wishing": 184, "numcomments": 2391, "numweights": 694, "averageweight": 1.1182, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 10953}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 526}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 119, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 69}, "2": {"best_rating": 52, "recommended_rating": 55, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3": {"best_rating": 51, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 70, "recommended_rating": 35, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "5": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 21}, "6": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 52, "not_recommended_rating": 33}, "7": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 66}, "8": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 68}, "8+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 79}}}, "usersrated": 11339.0, "average": 5.60143, "bayesaverage": 5.53929, "stddev": 1.45235, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19771.0, "trading": 169.0, "wanting": 13.0, "wishing": 184.0, "numcomments": 2391.0, "numweights": 694.0, "averageweight": 1.1182, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 10953}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 526}], "game_family": "Jenga", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "2453", "name": "Blokus", "alternative_names": ["Blokus Giant", "Blokus: Super einfach, einfach spannend", "Giant Blokus", "Tesselation Game", "Tessellation", "\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30b9", "\u683c\u683c\u4e0d\u5165", "\ube14\ub85c\ucee4\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/96YA5wUJDxtPkmPxemr5Qg__thumb/img/EBt2y7Awj5djyo185R7g6FV3P9g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2197702.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/96YA5wUJDxtPkmPxemr5Qg__original/img/YAFla7Wy8VSzT6RGTGQOCt-9JfI=/0x0/pic2197702.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Components: Polyominoes", "Game: Blokus", "Misc: Mensa Select"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Territory Building"], "implementations": ["Blokus 3D", "Blokus Dice Game", "Blokus Duo", "Blokus Junior"], "mechanics": ["Enclosure", "Grid Coverage", "Hand Management", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Bernard Tavitian"], "artists": ["Alan D.

The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.\n\nThere is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.\n\nComponents:\nBlokus Game Board (400 squares)\n84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)\nEach color inlcudes:\n\n     1 one-square piece\n     1 piece with 2 squares\n     2 pieces with 3 squares\n     5 pieces with 4 squares\n     12 pieces with 5 squares\n\n\n\n\nGoal of the Game:\n\nEach player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.\n\nHow to Play:\n1.  Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.\n\n2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.\n\n3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.\n\nEach new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.\n\nNo flat edges of same color pieces can touch.\n\nThere are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.\n\n4.  Whenever a player is unable to place one of his/her remaining pieces on the board, that player must pass his/her turn.\n\nEnd of Game:\nThe game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces.  This also includes any players who may have placed all of their pieces on the board.  Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner.\n\nScoring:\nEach player counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).\n\nA player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).\n\nThere are unauthorized versions of the game published under various names, including The Strategy Game, Tetris, Blok\u00e1d (unofficial Hungarian version with cardboard pieces) and The Family Chess Game.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2000, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 7, "stats": {"usersrated": 22447, "average": 6.88516, "bayesaverage": 6.75847, "stddev": 1.24426, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29942, "trading": 654, "wanting": 184, "wishing": 1535, "numcomments": 5038, "numweights": 1561, "averageweight": 1.7726, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 635}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 42}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 403, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 251}, "2": {"best_rating": 64, "recommended_rating": 218, "not_recommended_rating": 72}, "3": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 103, "not_recommended_rating": 233}, "4": {"best_rating": 357, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 230}}}, "usersrated": 22447.0, "average": 6.88516, "bayesaverage": 6.75847, "stddev": 1.24426, "median": 0.0, "owned": 29942.0, "trading": 654.0, "wanting": 184.0, "wishing": 1535.0, "numcomments": 5038.0, "numweights": 1561.0, "averageweight": 1.7726, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 635}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 42}], "game_family": "Blokus", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "2471", "name": "Zombies!!!", "alternative_names": ["Zombi!!!

They generate adrenaline to do things such as move, attack, and perform special actions like activating an objective space. That generation also has a negative effect for them, as that adrenaline transfers to the Overseer player, who then uses it to spawn aliens, create new threats, and hurt the soldiers' chance of success during the scenario.

You may be the first to create an artificial satellite, send a probe to another planet, or even put a man on the moon.\n\nLeaving Earth is a game about planning and about managing risk.  With even a single grand journey into outer space, you might claim victory in the game.  Consequently, it is your job to plan each journey carefully, finding the cheapest, quickest, and safest ways to reach your objective\u2014but do not spend too long preparing, or another nation might reach its goal before you.\n\nOn your turn, you will be conducting research, building spacecraft, and directing journeys into outer space. To conduct research, you buy an advancement that begins with certain flaws, then you test the advancement to find and eliminate those flaws.  To build a spacecraft, you purchase components and assemble them into a whole. To travel to outer space, you expend rockets to maneuver from one location to another.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "182732", "name": "Leaving Earth: Mercury"}, {"id": "190924", "name": "Leaving Earth: Outer Planets"}, {"id": "227951", "name": "Leaving Earth: Stations"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 15, "stats": {"usersrated": 2270, "average": 7.82022, "bayesaverage": 6.83455, "stddev": 1.53513, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4493, "trading": 69, "wanting": 723, "wishing": 3112, "numcomments": 654, "numweights": 156, "averageweight": 3.7115, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 536}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 91}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 285}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 115, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 57, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "3": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 46, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "4": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "5": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 48}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 58}}}, "usersrated": 2270.0, "average": 7.82022, "bayesaverage": 6.83455, "stddev": 1.53513, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4493.0, "trading": 69.0, "wanting": 723.0, "wishing": 3112.0, "numcomments": 654.0, "numweights": 156.0, "averageweight": 3.7115, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 536}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 91}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 285}], "game_family": "Leaving Earth", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "173346", "name": "7 Wonders Duel", "alternative_names": ["7 Csoda P\u00e1rbaj", "7 Cud\u00f3w \u015awiata: Pojedynek", "7 Div\u016f sv\u011bta: Duel", "7 \u0427\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441: \u0414\u0443\u044d\u043b\u044c", "7 \u0e2a\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e28\u0e08\u0e23\u0e23\u0e22\u0e4c \u0e14\u0e27\u0e25", "7 \uc6d0\ub354\uc2a4 \ub300\uacb0", "\u4e03\u5927\u5947\u8e5f \u5c0d\u6c7a", "\u4e03\u5927\u5947\u8ff9:\u5bf9\u51b3", "\u4e03\u5927\u5bf9\u51b3", "\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u4e03\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70:\u30c7\u30e5\u30a8\u30eb"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WzNs1mA_o22ZWTR8fkLP2g__thumb/img/qGf8-LJx4lsNOgpjS6iCs2TyKts=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3376065.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WzNs1mA_o22ZWTR8fkLP2g__original/img/M6wL1YFgW-PsdtJ328m2QiJf1K8=/0x0/pic3376065.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: 7 Wonders", "Game: 7 Wonders Duel", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Versions & Editions: Two-Player Versions of More-Player Games"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "City Building", "Civilization"], "implementations": ["7 Wonders"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Drafting", "Set Collection", "Sudden Death Ending", "Tug of War"], "designers": ["Antoine Bauza", "Bruno Cathala"], "artists": ["Miguel Coimbra"], "publishers": ["Repos Production", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asterion Press", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Ludicus", "Ponva d.o.o.", "Pridemage Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Siam Board Games", "Sombreros Production"], "description": "In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.\n\nWhat's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.\n\nEach player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.\n\nPlayers can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.\n\nA player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "309116", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: Agora"}, {"id": "202976", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon"}, {"id": "310215", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: Solo"}, {"id": "196339", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: Statue of Liberty"}, {"id": "186069", "name": "7 Wonders Duel: The Messe Essen Promo Card"}, {"id": "274383", "name": "Leaders (fan expansion for 7 Wonders Duel)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 57187, "average": 8.10373, "bayesaverage": 7.97823, "stddev": 1.17587, "median": 0.0, "owned": 88995, "trading": 597, "wanting": 958, "wishing": 7815, "numcomments": 7948, "numweights": 1766, "averageweight": 2.2203, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 17}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 18}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 737, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 539}, "2": {"best_rating": 709, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 553}}}, "usersrated": 57187.0, "average": 8.10373, "bayesaverage": 7.97823, "stddev": 1.17587, "median": 0.0, "owned": 88995.0, "trading": 597.0, "wanting": 958.0, "wishing": 7815.0, "numcomments": 7948.0, "numweights": 1766.0, "averageweight": 2.2203, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 17}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 18}], "game_family": "7 Wonders", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "257501", "name": "KeyForge: Call of the Archons", "alternative_names": ["KeyForce: Ruf der Archonten", "KeyForge: Il Richiamo degli Arconti \u2013 Starter Set", "KeyForge: L'Appel des Archontes", "KeyForge: La llamada de los Arcontes", "KeyForge: O Chamado dos Arcontes", "KeyForge: Ruf der Archonten", "KeyForge: Zew Archont\u00f3w"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZzJ2NGZz4CXxr1VIRkQZtA__thumb/img/ywNMVg_jcW9XNWvn80xOB_nT7Eo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4298867.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZzJ2NGZz4CXxr1VIRkQZtA__original/img/vu0eiTk2Bd3pJF-qvVVIzFsy63c=/0x0/pic4298867.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Two players fighting games", "Components: Unique Game", "Game: KeyForge", "Players: Two Player Only Games"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Take That"], "designers": ["Richard Garfield"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "From the imagination of legendary game designer Richard Garfield comes a game unlike anything the world has ever seen\u2014a game where every deck is as unique as the person who wields it and no two battles will ever be the same. This is KeyForge, where deckbuilding and boosters are a thing of the past, where you can carve a path of discovery with every deck, where you can throw yourself into the game with the force of a wild wormhole and embrace the thrill of a tactical battle where wits will win the day!\n\nAlong with this new breed of game comes a new world: the Crucible, an artificial world built from the pieces of countless planets across the stars. Here, anything is possible. This world was built for the Archons, god-like beings who, for all their power, know little about their own origins. The Archons clash in constant struggles, leading motley companies of various factions as they seek to find and unlock the planet\u2019s hidden Vaults to gain ultimate knowledge and power.\n\nThis starter set contains two starter decks, two unique Archon Decks, and all the keys and tokens two players need to play!\n\nKeyForge: Call of the Archons is the world's first Unique Deck Game. Every single Archon Deck that you'll use to play is truly unique and one-of-a kind, with its own Archon and its own mixture of cards in the deck. If you pick up an Archon Deck, you know that you're the only person in existence with access to this exact deck and its distinct combination of cards. In fact, in just the first set of KeyForge: Call of the Archons, there are more than 104 quadrillion possible decks!\n\nEvery Archon Deck contains a full play experience with a deck that cannot be altered, meaning it's ready to play right out of the box. Not only does this remove the need for deckbuilding or boosters, it also creates a new form of gameplay with innovative mechanics that challenges you to use every card in your deck to find the strongest and most cunning combinations. It is not the cards themselves that are powerful, but rather the interactions between them\u2014interactions that can only be found in your deck. Your ability to make tough tactical decisions will determine your success as you and your opponent trade blows in clashes that can shift in an instant!\n\nKeyForge: Call of the Archons is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious \u00c6mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare \"Sanctum\" at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.\n\nNext, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival\u2019s forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more \u00c6mber to your pool.\n\nNotably, no card in KeyForge has a cost \u2014 choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more \u00c6mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of \u00c6mber, you won't move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six \u00c6mber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "272455", "name": "KeyForge: Age of Ascension \u2013 Archon Deck"}, {"id": "257606", "name": "KeyForge: Call of the Archons \u2013 Archon Deck"}, {"id": "301608", "name": "KeyForge: Mass Mutation \u2013 Archon Deck"}, {"id": "285780", "name": "KeyForge: Worlds Collide \u2013 Archon Deck"}, {"id": "285781", "name": "KeyForge: Worlds Collide \u2013 Premium Box"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 9023, "average": 7.31769, "bayesaverage": 6.97929, "stddev": 1.59499, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13886, "trading": 342, "wanting": 104, "wishing": 1228, "numcomments": 1464, "numweights": 182, "averageweight": 2.456, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 400}, {"id": "4667", "name": "cgs", "friendlyname": "Customizable Rank", "value": 26}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 91, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 75}, "2": {"best_rating": 90, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 71}}}, "usersrated": 9023.0, "average": 7.31769, "bayesaverage": 6.97929, "stddev": 1.59499, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13886.0, "trading": 342.0, "wanting": 104.0, "wishing": 1228.0, "numcomments": 1464.0, "numweights": 182.0, "averageweight": 2.456, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 400}, {"id": "4667", "name": "cgs", "friendlyname": "Customizable Rank", "value": 26}], "game_family": "KeyForge", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "290448", "name": "Wingspan: European Expansion", "alternative_names": ["Feszt\u00e1v: Eur\u00f3pai Madarak", "Fl\u00fcgelschlag: Europa-Erweiterung", "Na k\u0159\u00eddlech: Perut\u011b Evropy", "Na skrzyd\u0142ach: Ptaki Europy", "Wingspan Uitbreiding: Europa", "Wingspan: Espansione Europa", "Wingspan: Espansione Europea", "Wingspan: Extensia Europeana", "Wingspan: Extension Europe", "\u041a\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430: \u041f\u0442\u0430\u0445\u0438 \u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438", "\u041a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u044c\u044f: \u041f\u0442\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u044b", "\u0e1b\u0e35\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32 \u0e20\u0e32\u0e04\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21: \u0e19\u0e01\u0e22\u0e38\u0e42\u0e23\u0e1b", "\uc719\uc2a4\ud32c: \uc720\ub7fd \ud655\uc7a5"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7izK8WM_bgtvBzxQvLGz-A__thumb/img/Q76pV0p00R8qkcS6o-nczJD7DCk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4982682.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7izK8WM_bgtvBzxQvLGz-A__original/img/1zKUFYpi-v2ygHweEr1SC9XAw3Y=/0x0/pic4982682.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Birds", "Game: Wingspan", "Theme: Nature"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Animals", "Economic", "Educational"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "End Game Bonuses", "Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Elizabeth Hargrave"], "artists": ["Ana Maria Martinez Jaramillo", "Natalia Rojas", "Beth Sobel"], "publishers": ["Stonemaier Games", "999 Games", "Angry Lion Games", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Feuerland Spiele", "Ghenos Games", "Lavka Games", "Maldito Games", "Matagot", "MINDOK", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Regatul Jocurilor", "Siam Board Games", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433"], "description": "In this first expansion to Wingspan, we increase the scope of the world to include the regal, beautiful, and varied birds of Europe.

emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.\n\nEach turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.\nNext, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.\n\nThe game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.\n\nA lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "235255", "name": "Taluva Extension"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2006, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 7703, "average": 7.17169, "bayesaverage": 6.87542, "stddev": 1.27584, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7723, "trading": 151, "wanting": 549, "wishing": 2132, "numcomments": 2001, "numweights": 677, "averageweight": 2.2718, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 498}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 25}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 313}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 181, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 86}, "2": {"best_rating": 94, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 17}, "3": {"best_rating": 61, "recommended_rating": 86, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4": {"best_rating": 48, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 69}}}, "usersrated": 7703.0, "average": 7.17169, "bayesaverage": 6.87542, "stddev": 1.27584, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7723.0, "trading": 151.0, "wanting": 549.0, "wishing": 2132.0, "numcomments": 2001.0, "numweights": 677.0, "averageweight": 2.2718, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 498}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 25}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 313}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "121921", "name": "Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island", "alternative_names": ["Robinson Crusoe: Abenteuer auf der verfluchten Insel", "Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island", "Robinson Crusoe: Aventuras en la Isla Maldita", "Robinson Crusoe: Aventuras na Ilha Amaldi\u00e7oada", "Robinson Cruso\u00e9: Aventures sur l'\u00eele maudite", "Robinson Crusoe: Dobrodru\u017estv\u00ed na proklet\u00e9m ostrov\u011b", "Robinson Crusoe: Kalandok Az El\u00e1tkozott Szigeten", "Robinson Crusoe: Przygoda na przekl\u0119tej wyspie", "Robinson Crusoe: Viaggio verso l'Isola Maledetta", "Robinson Crusoes Verm\u00e4chtnis", "\u0420\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0437\u043e\u043d \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043e: \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435", "\u9c81\u6ee8\u900a\u6f02\u6d41\u8bb0\uff1a\u8bc5\u5492\u5c9b\u4e4b\u8ff7", "\ub85c\ube48\uc2a8 \ud06c\ub8e8\uc18c: \uc800\uc8fc\ubc1b\uc740 \uc12c\uc758 \ubaa8\ud5d8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FbFnaTx3aT5dM18K_bR_Pg__thumb/img/K1ZUx-QNGg-Kkm2D9iUX4bL0-IM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3165731.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FbFnaTx3aT5dM18K_bR_Pg__original/img/i1d3Zbbw5iYJ5_Bd0unqwgM8CI0=/0x0/pic3165731.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Dice with Icons", "Game: Robinson Crusoe \u2013 Adventures on the Cursed Island", "Misc: LongPack Games", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Survival", "Theme: Tropical Islands"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fighting", "Novel-based"], "implementations": ["First Martians: Adventures on the Red Planet"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Hexagon Grid", "Narrative Choice / Paragraph", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Ignacy Trzewiczek"], "artists": ["Tomasz Bentkowski", "Mateusz Bielski", "Vincent Dutrait", "Jerzy Ferdyn", "Mateusz Kopacz", "Mateusz Lenart", "Maciej Mutwil", "Zhao Run Quan", "Rafa\u0142 Szyma", "Piotr S\u0142aby", "Ignacy Trzewiczek", "Micha\u0142 J.

village from incarnations of the lord of hell \u2013 Wu-Feng \u2013 and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.\n\nThe players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own \u2013 some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.\n\nTo exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.\n\nTo win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.\n\nThere are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "59967", "name": "Ghost Stories: B-Rice Lee"}, {"id": "160481", "name": "Ghost Stories: Band of Brothers"}, {"id": "95699", "name": "Ghost Stories: Black Secret"}, {"id": "54833", "name": "Ghost Stories: Chuck No-Rice"}, {"id": "123920", "name": "Ghost Stories: Crazy Shaman"}, {"id": "166161", "name": "Ghost Stories: Guard Tower"}, {"id": "69467", "name": "Ghost Stories: Jean-Claude Van Rice"}, {"id": "185242", "name": "Ghost Stories: Promo Pack"}, {"id": "39428", "name": "Ghost Stories: The Guardhouse Expansion"}, {"id": "110906", "name": "Ghost Stories: The Infernal Die"}, {"id": "47616", "name": "Ghost Stories: White Moon"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2008, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 19173, "average": 7.32492, "bayesaverage": 7.15969, "stddev": 1.41704, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25149, "trading": 609, "wanting": 808, "wishing": 5566, "numcomments": 4236, "numweights": 993, "averageweight": 2.9104, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 259}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 84}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 206}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 342, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 69, "recommended_rating": 143, "not_recommended_rating": 55}, "2": {"best_rating": 53, "recommended_rating": 180, "not_recommended_rating": 39}, "3": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 183, "not_recommended_rating": 47}, "4": {"best_rating": 237, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 144}}}, "usersrated": 19173.0, "average": 7.32492, "bayesaverage": 7.15969, "stddev": 1.41704, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25149.0, "trading": 609.0, "wanting": 808.0, "wishing": 5566.0, "numcomments": 4236.0, "numweights": 993.0, "averageweight": 2.9104, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 259}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 84}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 206}], "game_family": "Ghost Stories", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 11, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "37111", "name": "Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game", "alternative_names": ["Battlestar Galactica: Das Brettspiel", "Battlestar Galactica: El juego de tablero", "Battlestar Galactica: Gra planszowa", "Battlestar Galactica: il gioco da tavolo", "Battlestar Galactica: Le Jeu de Plateau", "\u592a\u7a7a\u5821\u5792 \u5361\u62c9\u72c4\u52a0", "\u592a\u7a7a\u5821\u5792\u5361\u62c9\u72c4\u52a0"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q2w2rFJiFI_uV89KP6ECg__thumb/img/s1BljxEdoxQ1zGYiw05Qa9rg9hI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic354500.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q2w2rFJiFI_uV89KP6ECg__original/img/-hZFpTm-evjyuLD_bj-y845-4f8=/0x0/pic354500.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards", "TV Shows: Battlestar Galactica"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Political", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Hidden Roles", "Once-Per-Game Abilities", "Role Playing", "Team-Based Game", "Traitor Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Variable Setup", "Voting"], "designers": ["Corey Konieczka"], "artists": ["Kevin Childress", "Andrew Navaro", "Brian Schomburg", "WiL Springer"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "Edge Entertainment", "Editrice Giochi", "Galakta", "Game Harbor", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag"], "description": "Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.\n\nAfter the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival\u2026but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?\n\nBattlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.\n\nOfficial Site, Rules & FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&esem=4\nUnofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "105136", "name": "Battlestar Galactica: Official Variant Rules"}, {"id": "141648", "name": "Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game \u2013 Daybreak Expansion"}, {"id": "85905", "name": "Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game \u2013 Exodus Expansion"}, {"id": "43539", "name": "Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game \u2013 Pegasus Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2008, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 32574, "average": 7.74338, "bayesaverage": 7.57764, "stddev": 1.57796, "median": 0.0, "owned": 35463, "trading": 704, "wanting": 799, "wishing": 5965, "numcomments": 6653, "numweights": 2086, "averageweight": 3.2426, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 80}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 23}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 986, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 592}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 604}, "3": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 163, "not_recommended_rating": 536}, "4": {"best_rating": 53, "recommended_rating": 548, "not_recommended_rating": 206}, "5": {"best_rating": 766, "recommended_rating": 161, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "6": {"best_rating": 294, "recommended_rating": 478, "not_recommended_rating": 76}, "6+": {"best_rating": 29, "recommended_rating": 117, "not_recommended_rating": 321}}}, "usersrated": 32574.0, "average": 7.74338, "bayesaverage": 7.57764, "stddev": 1.57796, "median": 0.0, "owned": 35463.0, "trading": 704.0, "wanting": 799.0, "wishing": 5965.0, "numcomments": 6653.0, "numweights": 2086.0, "averageweight": 3.2426, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 80}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 23}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "242639", "name": "Treasure Island", "alternative_names": ["A Ilha do Tesouro", "La Isla del Tesoro", "L'Isola del Tesoro", "L'\u00cele au Tr\u00e9sor", "Wyspa Skarb\u00f3w: Z\u0142oto Johna Silvera", "\u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u043e\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449: \u0422\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430", "\ubcf4\ubb3c\uc12c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_jRH6vLRmKoVDtTJoUtZaA__thumb/img/yRbs2hjxsUAbgk2Dkju7pYdZnLY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3895468.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_jRH6vLRmKoVDtTJoUtZaA__original/img/PTHk_oYIFdQ16cstE_ErOmZ3RME=/0x0/pic3895468.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Players: One versus Many"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Exploration", "Novel-based", "Pirates"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Line Drawing", "Measurement Movement", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Storytelling", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Marc Paquien"], "artists": ["Vincent Dutrait"], "publishers": ["Matagot", "Conclave Editora", "Gen-X Games", "Hobby World", "Mancalamaro", "Mandoo Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "Long John Silver's crew has committed mutiny and has him cornered and tied up!

The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\n\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 5, "maxplayers": 10, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 17400, "average": 7.56957, "bayesaverage": 7.29408, "stddev": 1.58426, "median": 0.0, "owned": 23626, "trading": 187, "wanting": 494, "wishing": 4591, "numcomments": 2798, "numweights": 301, "averageweight": 1.691, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 183}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 13}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 247, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 180}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 180}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 181}, "4": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 179}, "5": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 75, "not_recommended_rating": 120}, "6": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 129, "not_recommended_rating": 50}, "7": {"best_rating": 94, "recommended_rating": 120, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "8": {"best_rating": 141, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "9": {"best_rating": 92, "recommended_rating": 112, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "10": {"best_rating": 113, "recommended_rating": 86, "not_recommended_rating": 17}, "10+": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 126}}}, "usersrated": 17400.0, "average": 7.56957, "bayesaverage": 7.29408, "stddev": 1.58426, "median": 0.0, "owned": 23626.0, "trading": 187.0, "wanting": 494.0, "wishing": 4591.0, "numcomments": 2798.0, "numweights": 301.0, "averageweight": 1.691, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 183}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 13}], "game_family": "Werewolf / Mafia", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "8", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "188920", "name": "This War of Mine: The Board Game", "alternative_names": ["This War of Mine", "This War of Mine: Das Brettspiel", "This War of Mine: Deskov\u00e1 hra", "This War of Mine: El juego de mesa", "This War of Mine: El juego de tablero", "This War of Mine: Gra planszowa", "This War of Mine: il Gioco da Tavolo", "This War of Mine: le jeu de plateau", "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430: \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430", "\ub514\uc2a4 \uc6cc \uc624\ube0c \ub9c8\uc778: \ubcf4\ub4dc \uac8c\uc784"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQOQW7p1RWHzY54Lrs-_pA__thumb/img/qmypl6agXd78n1_vAiO5LZcCXHc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3315915.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQOQW7p1RWHzY54Lrs-_pA__original/img/VmqDT6K9qJyjmq3oHdJmdrmhdII=/0x0/pic3315915.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: This War of Mine (Awaken Realms)", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Survival"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Mature / Adult", "Modern Warfare", "Video Game Theme"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Push Your Luck", "Role Playing", "Simulation", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Micha\u0142 Oracz", "Jakub Wi\u015bniewski"], "artists": ["Pawe\u0142 Nizio\u0142ek", "Micha\u0142 Oracz", "Piotr Gacek"], "publishers": ["Awaken Realms", "11 bit studios", "Albi", "Ares Games", "Asmodee", "CrowD Games", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Pendragon Game Studio", "Summon Games"], "description": "This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city.\n\nYou will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city, enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity.\n\nDuring day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements\u2019 shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, you\u2019ll try to keep it warm.\n\nUpon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.). On your way you will meet tens of characters, each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit, thieves, bandits, soldiers, war victims, refugees, neighbors, traders and members of local communities), each encounter is a potential, unique adventure. To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous).\n\nYour goal is to SURVIVE until the cessation of war hostilities. During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices (you will have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later in the playthrough). Survival itself will often prove not to be enough. The price each of you will decide to pay, might be too high in the final outcome. So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made. The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here.\n\nTWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant.

You have an army of men at your disposal and six bombs.  Your mission--protect your flag and capture your opponent's flag.\n\nSecretly place your men, bombs, and flag on the gameboard with these objectives in mind.  But remember your opponent is doing the same thing, so you must plan a defense as well as an offense.\n\nOnce the armies are in place, advance your men.  When you're one space away from an enemy, attack.  You and your opponent declare ranks.  The lower-ranking man is captured and out of play.\n\nYou control your pieces and risk your men in battles where the strength of your enemy is unknown. The suspense builds as your men move deeper into enemy territory. Move with caution and courage. The next piece you attack could be a bomb.  And when attacked, it could \"blast\" your man off the board and out of play.\n\nThe first to capture an enemy flag is the winner!\n\nThis game is similar to, and almost certainly derived directly from, the H.P. Gibsons (UK) game L'Attaque (1909). It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) This game in turn almost certainly drew on the classic Chinese children's game Jungle.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire & Ice)\n     The Generals\n     Stratego Legends\n     Stratego: Star Wars\n     Stratego: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition\n     Ultimate Stratego\n     Electronic Stratego\n     Stratego: Marvel Heroes\n     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition\n     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia\n\n\n\n\nand numerous others.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    Admirals\n    Lu Zhan Jun Qi\n    L'Attaque\n    Attack\n    Batalj\n    Sharpe's Attack\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Edition Complications\nWhen first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.\nWhen they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....\nThen, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.\nThis caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.\nThis wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!

Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.\n\nAdmit it. You love it.\n\nThis award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...\n\nAnd it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOther\n\nPart of the Munchkin series.\n\nMunchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich\u00e9s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.\n\nThere are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in \"bad stuff\" which usually involves losing levels and treasure.\n\nIn May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the \"big announcement.\" Many rules and cards were changed.

At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.\n\nThe best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their \"native\" currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.\n\nIn Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.\n\nThe money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.\n\nPlayers with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external \"wall\" section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.\n\nIntegrates

4 (1 to 6 with the 'Riverfolk' expansion) players battle for control of a vast wilderness.\n\nThe nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.\n\nRoot represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.\n\nThe Cats play a game of engine building and logistics while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to produce workshops, lumber mills, and barracks. They win by building new buildings and crafts.\n\nThe Eyrie musters their hawks to take back the Woods. They must capture as much territory as possible and build roosts before they collapse back into squabbling.\n\nThe Alliance hides in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build towards a dramatic late-game presence--but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for their own gain, while hiding a mysterious quest. Explore the board, fight other factions, and work towards achieving your hidden goal.\n\nIn Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "287220", "name": "Root: The Clockwork Expansion"}, {"id": "272638", "name": "Root: The Exiles and Partisans Deck"}, {"id": "241386", "name": "Root: The Riverfolk Expansion"}, {"id": "272637", "name": "Root: The Underworld Expansion"}, {"id": "309977", "name": "Root: The Vagabond Pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 22081, "average": 8.09521, "bayesaverage": 7.84935, "stddev": 1.4245, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33691, "trading": 214, "wanting": 1690, "wishing": 11934, "numcomments": 3561, "numweights": 873, "averageweight": 3.6529, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 31}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 15}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 28}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 473, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 51, "not_recommended_rating": 258}, "2": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 137, "not_recommended_rating": 224}, "3": {"best_rating": 100, "recommended_rating": 270, "not_recommended_rating": 33}, "4": {"best_rating": 369, "recommended_rating": 70, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4+": {"best_rating": 29, "recommended_rating": 88, "not_recommended_rating": 159}}}, "usersrated": 22081.0, "average": 8.09521, "bayesaverage": 7.84935, "stddev": 1.4245, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33691.0, "trading": 214.0, "wanting": 1690.0, "wishing": 11934.0, "numcomments": 3561.0, "numweights": 873.0, "averageweight": 3.6529, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 31}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 15}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 28}], "game_family": "Root", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false}, {"id": "206718", "name": "Ethnos", "alternative_names": ["\u042d\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441", "\u30a8\u30b9\u30ce\u30b9", "\uc5d0\uc2a4\ub178\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UIKUXkcnH3Bd4fjcPGINcA__thumb/img/oNhw2e_wcBc37ItkTRZVio2gMGQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3304124.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UIKUXkcnH3Bd4fjcPGINcA__original/img/l3bgYwqwolui5dk6nYKmirbAHC4=/0x0/pic3304124.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Continental / National scale)"], "categories": ["Fantasy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Paolo Mori"], "artists": ["John Howe"], "publishers": ["Asterion Press", "BoardM Factory", "CMON Limited", "Conclave Editora", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "Lavka Games", "Portal Games", "REXhry", "Spaghetti Western Games", "\u041d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b", "\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b1\u30f3\u30d3\u30eb (KenBill)"], "description": "In Ethnos, players call upon the support of giants, merfolk, halflings, minotaurs, and other fantasy tribes to help them gain control of the land. After three ages of play, whoever has collected the most glory wins!\n\nIn more detail, the land of Ethnos contains twelve tribes of fantasy creatures, and in each game you choose six of them (five in a 2/3-player game), then create a deck with only the creatures in those tribes. The cards come in six colors, which match the six regions of Ethnos. Place three glory tokens in each region at random, arranging them from low to high.\n\nEach player starts the game with one card in hand, then 4-12 cards (double the number of players) are placed face up on the table. On a turn, a player either recruits an ally or plays a band of allies. In the former case, you take a face-up card (without replacing it from the deck) or the top card of the deck and add it to your hand. In the latter case, you choose a set of cards in your hand that match either in tribe or in color, play them in front of you on the table, then discard all other cards in hand. You then place one token in the region that matches the color of the top card just played, and you use the power of the tribe member on the top card just played.\n\nAt the end of the first age, whoever has the most tokens in a region scores the glory shown on the first token. After the second age, the players with the most and second most tokens score glory equal to the values shown on the first and second tokens respectively. Players score similarly after the third age, then whoever has the most glory wins.

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.\n\nThe players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.\n\nYour basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.\n\nEach player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:\n\n1) Player order shifts clockwise.\n2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.\n3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.\n4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.\n\nWhen the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "296298", "name": "French Championship Promo Cards (fan expansion for Terraforming Mars)"}, {"id": "317189", "name": "Meeple BR Jogos Promo Pack #1"}, {"id": "322281", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Asteroid Rights Promo Card"}, {"id": "265081", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Atmo Collectors Promo Card"}, {"id": "241497", "name": "Terraforming Mars: BGG User-Created Corporation Pack"}, {"id": "311247", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Big Box"}, {"id": "312319", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Big Box Promo Pack"}, {"id": "255681", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Colonies"}, {"id": "218127", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Hellas & Elysium"}, {"id": "265083", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Jovian Lanterns Promo Card"}, {"id": "265084", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Lunar Exports Promo Card"}, {"id": "230241", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Penguins Promo Card"}, {"id": "247030", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Prelude"}, {"id": "230123", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Self Replicating Robots Promo Card"}, {"id": "202825", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Small Asteroid Promo Card"}, {"id": "226297", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Snow Algae Promo Card"}, {"id": "273473", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Turmoil"}, {"id": "279345", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Turmoil Promos"}, {"id": "231965", "name": "Terraforming Mars: Venus Next"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 61522, "average": 8.43099, "bayesaverage": 8.2833, "stddev": 1.37919, "median": 0.0, "owned": 81682, "trading": 381, "wanting": 2106, "wishing": 16939, "numcomments": 9144, "numweights": 2490, "averageweight": 3.2365, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 5}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1605, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 146, "recommended_rating": 734, "not_recommended_rating": 221}, "2": {"best_rating": 304, "recommended_rating": 878, "not_recommended_rating": 139}, "3": {"best_rating": 903, "recommended_rating": 410, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "4": {"best_rating": 569, "recommended_rating": 606, "not_recommended_rating": 95}, "5": {"best_rating": 76, "recommended_rating": 424, "not_recommended_rating": 614}, "5+": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 698}}}, "usersrated": 61522.0, "average": 8.43099, "bayesaverage": 8.2833, "stddev": 1.37919, "median": 0.0, "owned": 81682.0, "trading": 381.0, "wanting": 2106.0, "wishing": 16939.0, "numcomments": 9144.0, "numweights": 2490.0, "averageweight": 3.2365, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 5}], "game_family": "Terraforming Mars", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 19, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "159675", "name": "Fields of Arle", "alternative_names": ["Arler Erde", "Campos de Arle", "De Friesche Velden", "Pola Arle", "Terres d'Arle", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30eb\u306e\u4e18", "\u963f\u52d2\u519c\u573a\uff08\u963f\u52d2\u8fb2\u5834\uff09", "\uc544\ub97c\uc758 \ud3c9\uc6d0: \ube45 \ubc15\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0w8go6cfvlpgJKydHUkDtA__thumb/img/0z1o-kU2xYwmVO8oNszdt1V4K54=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2225968.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0w8go6cfvlpgJKydHUkDtA__original/img/xlgiqGRKx6LZuhjh5iR-dtbMrJQ=/0x0/pic2225968.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Animals: Cattle / Cows", "Animals: Horses", "Animals: Sheep", "Category: Combinatorial", "Components: Meeples (Animal) / Animeeples", "Country: Germany", "Crowdfunding: Wspieram", "Game: Fields of Arle", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg)", "Theme: Gardening", "Theme: Nature"], "categories": ["Economic", "Farming", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Automatic Resource Growth", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Dennis Lohausen"], "publishers": ["Feuerland Spiele", "999 Games", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Game Harbor", "Games Factory Publishing", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Maldito Games", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "Welcome to Arle\nIn Fields of Arle, created by Uwe Rosenberg, one to two players live as farmers in the small and peaceful town of Arle in East Frisia. The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity, with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax, or find other ways to make the most of the small town\u2019s prosperity.\n\nWork the Land\nWhether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise, always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you\u2019d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.\n\nTools of the Trade\nAt the outset of each half year, you\u2019ll choose how you\u2019d like to spend that time working. There are many ways to build your fortune. Use the Master space to increase the tools at your disposal, focus on the Cattle Trainer to make the most of your livestock, or build up your fleet of vehicles and ship out goods. Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall, and sheer your sheep in spring. At the end of each half year, you\u2019ll need to take stock of your progress by unloading your vehicles and feeding your family and animals, so keep an eye on the season and do your best to keep the farm growing and everyone well fed!\n\nTravel and Prosper\nOnce you\u2019ve made headway in clearing fields and stocking up goods, it's time to make your products available to potential buyers. The more vehicles you have, the more goods you can ship. Send things into the wide world to increase your Travel Experience and grant you points over the course of the four and a half years of the game. Build up your farm and your vehicles and get your goods out into the world to make the most of every season. There are many roads to success in Fields of Arle, so pick your path, work the land, and enjoy the friendly competition as you strive to make your fortune!\n\n- from the publisher's website\n\n",

Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.\n\nCorporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with \"ice\". These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.\n\nIn turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.\n\nThe first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.\n\nThe Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs. While the cards in this set have been released previously, the art on some of them is new.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "201553", "name": "Android: Netrunner \u2013 23 Seconds"}, {"id": "135103",

combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).\n\nStar Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat. It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent\u2019s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!\n\nMultiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios. Also, in the newest version, there are new ways to play that allow up to 6 players with modes like Boss, Hunter, and Free for All. You can also add Star Realms Colony Wars to the deck to make it 4 players. This is the first game of the Star Realms series.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFactions\n\nEach of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrade Federation\n\nIn the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation\u2019s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation\u2019s trade and other interests.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Blobs\n\nThese mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, \u201cThe Blobs\u201d. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStar Empire\n\nThe Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMachine Cult\n\nA cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlaying Star Realms\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u2039When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.\n\nAs you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent\u2019s Authority to zero and win the game, it\u2019s also useful for destroying your opponent\u2019s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent\u2019s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent\u2019s Authority directly.\n\nStar Realms is easy to learn, especially if you\u2019re familiar with deck-building games, but it\u2019s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent\u2019s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you\u2019ll be faced with. New players needn\u2019t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.\n\n", "expansions":

You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.\n\nNo matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.\n\nEach of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...\n\nThe basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand \u2014 and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better

The city was almost totally destroyed. The Marques of Pombal \u2014 Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo \u2014 was the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the King put him in charge of the reconstruction of Lisbon. The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew, with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings, but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune, but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs.\n\nLisboa is played on a real map of downtown Lisbon. During the planning of the downtown project, the type of business permitted in each street was previously determined. The economic motor is driven by the wealth of the royal treasure and this treasure is controlled by player actions during the game, making each game a totally different experience. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds and whoever gathers the most wigs by the end of the game wins.\n\nLisboa is played in rounds. Each round, all players play one turn. They may place one card on their display or replace one card from this display. During the game, players schedule hearings to get character favors, such as commerce, construction, and openings.

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\n\nDuring a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.\n\nAfter a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.\n\nEach month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.\n\nDuring the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.\n\nPart of the Pandemic series\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 40206, "average": 8.6177, "bayesaverage": 8.46773, "stddev": 1.57331, "median": 0.0, "owned": 63218, "trading": 286, "wanting": 830, "wishing": 10544, "numcomments": 6241, "numweights": 1108, "averageweight": 2.8339, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 2}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 626, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 316}, "2": {"best_rating": 104, "recommended_rating": 330, "not_recommended_rating": 78}, "3": {"best_rating": 111, "recommended_rating": 328, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "4": {"best_rating": 371, "recommended_rating": 150, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4+": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 328}}}, "usersrated": 40206.0, "average": 8.6177, "bayesaverage": 8.46773, "stddev": 1.57331, "median": 0.0, "owned": 63218.0, "trading": 286.0, "wanting": 830.0, "wishing": 10544.0, "numcomments": 6241.0, "numweights": 1108.0, "averageweight": 2.8339, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 2}], "game_family": "Pandemic", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "161970", "name": "Alchemists", "alternative_names": ["Alchemicy", "De Alchemist", "Die Alchemisten", "Alchimistes", "Alchimisti", "Alchimi\u0219tii", "Alchymist\u00e9", "Alquimistas", "\u0410\u043b\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0438", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30b1\u30df\u30b9\u30c8", "\u7149\u91d1\u8853\u58eb", "\uc54c\ucf00\ubbf8\uc2a4\ud2b8", "\uc5f0\uae08\uc220 \uc544\uce74\ub370\ubbf8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__thumb/img/-a0oJ_E49V_7PDW78W7KIyS3rF8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2241156.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__original/img/VKBFHqR2xm0EFGWfb1sPJZctMCs=/0x0/pic2241156.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Digital Hybrid - App Required", "Theme: Alchemy"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Fantasy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Card Drafting", "Constrained Bidding", "End Game Bonuses", "Events", "Hand Management", "Turn Order: Progressive"], "designers": ["Mat\u00fa\u0161 Kotry"], "artists": ["David Cochard"], "publishers": ["Czech Games Edition", "Arclight", "Cranio Creations", "Devir", "DiceTree Games", "GaGa Games", "The Game Master BV", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "IELLO", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lex Games", "MINDOK", "One Moment Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art.

At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.\nPlayers declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.\n\nDuring play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nFlavor text:\nMandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad \u2014 these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.\n\nBut what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects \u2014 or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see.

Careful use of science can mitigate the harmful effects of industry, and can also help avert global crises.\n\nEnergy Empire uses worker placement, tableau-building, and resource management mechanics. On each turn, a player can choose to either work or generate. On a work turn, a player plays a single worker on the main board, then uses workers and energy to activate cards in their tableau. Players may spend energy to use an occupied space on the main board, so no spaces are ever completely blocked.

Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.\n\nAs the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy \u2013 if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.\n\nIn each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they'll find.

Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands & Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.\"\n\n\"The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.\"\n\n\"Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill Games, Inc., Commands & Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.\"\n\n\"The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.\"\n\n\"The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol.\"\n\n\"The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan, to achieve victory.\"\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "22605", "name": "Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #1 \u2013 Greece & Eastern Kingdoms"}, {"id": "24089", "name": "Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #2 \u2013 Rome vs the Barbarians"}, {"id": "29853", "name": "Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #3 \u2013 The Roman Civil Wars"}, {"id": "38928", "name": "Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #4 \u2013 Imperial Rome"}, {"id": "38927", "name": "Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #5 \u2013 Epic Ancients II"}, {"id": "88853", "name": "Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #6 \u2013 The Spartan Army"}, {"id": "169521", "name": "Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansions #2 and #3 \u2013 Rome vs the Barbarians; The Roman Civil Wars"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2006, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 7926, "average": 7.78183, "bayesaverage": 7.38773, "stddev": 1.41921, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10398, "trading": 282, "wanting": 589, "wishing": 2594, "numcomments": 2644, "numweights": 1019, "averageweight": 2.6948, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 139}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 20}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 150, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 38, "not_recommended_rating": 65}, "2": {"best_rating": 132, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 56}}}, "usersrated": 7926.0, "average": 7.78183, "bayesaverage": 7.38773, "stddev": 1.41921, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10398.0, "trading": 282.0, "wanting": 589.0, "wishing": 2594.0, "numcomments": 2644.0, "numweights": 1019.0, "averageweight": 2.6948, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 139}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 20}], "game_family": "Commands & Colors", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "225694", "name": "Decrypto", "alternative_names": ["K\u00f3dfejt\u0151", "\u0414\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440", "\u0414\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u043e", "\u622a\u78bc\u6230", "\ub514\ud06c\ub9bd\ud1a0"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__thumb/img/O5XHaPOALYquS058qcXWVm5b_k4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3759421.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__original/img/Nq39bGSnCjYDhmwNQlFdNHoSjsQ=/0x0/pic3759421.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Mechanism: Give a Clue / Get a Clue", "Word Games: Guess the Word"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Party Game", "Spies/Secret Agents", "Word Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Communication Limits", "Targeted Clues", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": ["Thomas Dagenais-Lesp\u00e9rance"], "artists": ["Fabien Fulchiron", "NILS", "Manuel Sanchez"], "publishers": ["Le Scorpion Masqu\u00e9", "2 Pionki", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "Fantasmagoria", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "GoKids \u73a9\u6a02\u5c0f\u5b50", "Happy Baobab", "IELLO", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Lavka Games", "Lex Games", "Portal Games"], "description": "Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team.\n\nIn more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team. In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are \"pig\", \"candy\", \"tent\", and \"son\", then I might say \"Sam-striped-pink\" and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.\n\nStarting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, \"sucker-prince-stake\". The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)\n\nThe rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "249122", "name": "Decrypto: AI Serial \u2013 Bruno Cathala 01"}, {"id": "248872", "name": "Decrypto: AI Serial \u2013 Rob Daviau 01"}, {"id": "273938", "name": "Decrypto: Expansion #01 \u2013 Laserdrive"}, {"id": "280470", "name": "Decrypto: Klingon"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 10812, "average": 7.79398, "bayesaverage": 7.47923, "stddev": 1.2361, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17366, "trading": 125, "wanting": 437, "wishing": 3284, "numcomments": 1545, "numweights": 180, "averageweight": 1.8111, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 105}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 1}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 165, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 109}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 108}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 97}, "4": {"best_rating": 91, "recommended_rating": 55, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 85, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "6": {"best_rating": 116, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "7": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 76, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "8": {"best_rating": 34, "recommended_rating": 69, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "8+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 72}}}, "usersrated": 10812.0, "average": 7.79398, "bayesaverage": 7.47923, "stddev": 1.2361, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17366.0, "trading": 125.0, "wanting": 437.0, "wishing": 3284.0, "numcomments": 1545.0, "numweights": 180.0, "averageweight": 1.8111, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 105}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 1}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": true}, {"id": "161417", "name": "Red7", "alternative_names": ["7 Rosso", "Red", "Red 7", "Red Seven", "Ruz7"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7zH6Kt5ebWEixjDGmHweNA__thumb/img/PVkJyJhCtzo1ZwKO4iuRaqUyKJc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2247258.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7zH6Kt5ebWEixjDGmHweNA__original/img/BlQg-C_qu02XAyIXZICX9znzfF0=/0x0/pic2247258.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Number"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Carl Chudyk", "Chris Cieslik"], "artists": ["Alanna Cervenak"], "publishers": ["Asmadi Games", "999 Games", "Albi", "Bureau de Juegos", "Cranio Creations", "Hobby World", "Lucrum Games", "MINDOK", "Nuts!

The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice\u2014just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope\u2014if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.\n\nIn the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.\n\nPrinted on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!\n\nEach of the three expansions for Gloom adds one more player, thus with all three expansions, this should be playable with seven players.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "217722", "name": "Gloom: Bookmark of Death"}, {"id": "301250", "name": "Gloom: Coffee Cup Out of Time Promo Card"}, {"id": "304031", "name": "Gloom: Game of Trades promo card"}, {"id": "319700", "name": "Gloom: Knighted by a Noble Promo"}, {"id": "293819", "name": "Gloom: Shot by a Scorpion Promo Card"}, {"id": "140772", "name": "Gloom: TableTop Promo Expansion"}, {"id": "197145", "name": "Gloom: The Looking Glass Promo Card"}, {"id": "37654", "name": "Gloom: Unfortunate Expeditions"}, {"id": "18207", "name": "Gloom: Unhappy Homes"}, {"id": "149327", "name": "Gloom: Unquiet Dead"}, {"id": "25621", "name": "Gloom: Unwelcome Guests"}, {"id": "293170", "name": "Gloom: Went Dark in the Night Promo"}, {"id": "126532", "name": "Munchkin Duck of Gloom"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2005, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 13373, "average": 6.33995, "bayesaverage": 6.18123, "stddev": 1.42316, "median": 0.0, "owned": 26036, "trading": 756, "wanting": 138, "wishing": 1500, "numcomments": 2892, "numweights": 684, "averageweight": 1.6345, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1730}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 479}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 100, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 68}, "2": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "3": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 56, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 37}}}, "usersrated": 13373.0, "average": 6.33995, "bayesaverage": 6.18123, "stddev": 1.42316, "median": 0.0, "owned": 26036.0, "trading": 756.0, "wanting": 138.0, "wishing": 1500.0, "numcomments": 2892.0, "numweights": 684.0, "averageweight": 1.6345, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1730}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 479}], "game_family": "Gloom", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 13, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "12942", "name": "No Thanks!", "alternative_names": ["Ei, ait\u00e4h", "Geschenkt ... ist noch zu teuer!", "Gesjaakt", "Micsoda Pech #!?", "Nincs kegyelem!", "No Merci", "No Merci!", "No Thanks", "Non Merci", "Oh S#!?", "Prezencik", "Scho\u0308ne Sch#!?e", "\u00a1No Gracias!", "\u038c\u03c7\u03b9 \u0395\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce", "\u041d\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0436, \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e!", "\u05e7\u05e7\u05d8\u05d5\u05e1", "\u30b2\u30b7\u30a7\u30f3\u30af", "\u4e0d\u4e86\u4e0d\u4e86", "\u4e0d\u901f\u4e4b\u79ae", "\u656c\u8b1d\u4e0d\u654f", "\u79ae\u7269", "\ub178 \ub561\uc2a4!"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2DyxMVASynw87LRULZuyqA__thumb/img/yIUSMoN8O5FeDZjXa4vreKj5Ogw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4657706.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2DyxMVASynw87LRULZuyqA__original/img/9q-Txph_yOf3zOGOL8_AnlUN5IE=/0x0/pic4657706.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Misc: Lowest Score Wins"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Closed Economy Auction", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Push Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Thorsten Gimmler"], "artists": ["Oliver Freudenreich", "Dennis Lohausen", "Atelier L\u00f6wentor"], "publishers": ["AMIGO", "999 Games", "Asmodee", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Dal Negro", "Dr. Wood Challenge Centre", "Fractal Juegos", "G3", "Gigamic", "KADABRA", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Kikigagne?", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Mayfair Games", "M\u00f6bius Games", "Morapiaf", "PaperGames (III)", "Piatnik", "Shafir Games (\u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d7\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8)", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Venner\u00f8d Forlag AS", "VR Distribution", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.\n\nThe rules are simple.  Each turn, players have two options:\n\n    play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card\n    pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game.  The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value.  Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.  Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.\n\nThe first versions of the game supported up to five players, but a 2011 edition supports up to seven.\n\nThis game was originally published in Germany by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!.  Amigo's international edition, titled No Merci! (a delightful multi-lingual pun), had rules in several languages, including English.

Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.\n\nThe game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\n\nAction Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "299490", "name": "War of the Ring: Kings of Middle-earth"}, {"id": "122328", "name": "War of the Ring: Lords of Middle-earth"}, {"id": "132430", "name": "War of the Ring: Lords of Middle-earth \u2013 Treebeard Mini-Expansion"}, {"id": "188886", "name": "War of the Ring: Scenario \u2013 The Breaking of the Fellowship"}, {"id": "179404", "name": "War of the Ring: Warriors of Middle-earth"}, {"id": "210039", "name": "War of the Ring: Warriors of Middle-earth \u2013 Tidings Not Burdens Mini-Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 150, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 13139, "average": 8.4777, "bayesaverage": 8.09419, "stddev": 1.49983, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21308, "trading": 207, "wanting": 1240, "wishing": 7682, "numcomments": 2423, "numweights": 723, "averageweight": 4.13, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 11}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 6}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 292, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 19, "not_recommended_rating": 159}, "2": {"best_rating": 267, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "3": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 46, "not_recommended_rating": 141}, "4": {"best_rating": 23, "recommended_rating": 76, "not_recommended_rating": 108}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 148}}}, "usersrated": 13139.0, "average": 8.4777, "bayesaverage": 8.09419, "stddev": 1.49983, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21308.0, "trading": 207.0, "wanting": 1240.0, "wishing": 7682.0, "numcomments": 2423.0, "numweights": 723.0, "averageweight": 4.13, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 11}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 6}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "72125", "name": "Eclipse", "alternative_names": ["\u661f\u8680", "\uc774\ud074\ub9bd\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cnFppsVNOSTJ-W3APQFuTg__thumb/img/X8XQO2_mRl7HRSzzOEgoKrWulj4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1974056.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cnFppsVNOSTJ-W3APQFuTg__original/img/583Qqo-5M56np8LqnFKcCuUfn7A=/0x0/pic1974056.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Control Boards", "Components: Map (Interplanetary or Interstellar scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Game: Eclipse (Lautapelit.fi)", "Mechanism: 4X"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Fighting", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Wargame"], "implementations": ["Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hexagon Grid", "Map Addition", "Modular Board", "Player Elimination", "Tile Placement", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Touko Tahkokallio"], "artists": ["Ossi Hiekkala", "Sampo Siki\u00f6"], "publishers": ["Lautapelit.fi", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Ystari Games"], "description": "The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years.

On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "268257", "name": "The Cauldron: Adrift (fan expansion for Sentinels of the Multiverse)"}, {"id": "221834", "name": "The Cauldron: Base Set (fan expansion for Sentinels of the Multiverse)"}, {"id": "225995", "name": "The Cauldron: Experimental (fan expansion for Sentinels of the Multiverse)"}, {"id": "225997", "name": "The Cauldron: Promo Pack #1 (fan expansion for Sentinels of the Multiverse)"}, {"id": "225998", "name": "The Cauldron: Promo Pack #2 (fan expansion for Sentinels of the Multiverse)"}, {"id": "268258", "name": "The Cauldron: Promo Pack #3 (fan expansion for Sentinels of the Multiverse)"}, {"id": "225996", "name": "The Cauldron: Stormfall (fan expansion for Sentinels of the Multiverse)"}, {"id": "188571", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: 2015 Holiday Promo Pack"}, {"id": "209651", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: 5th Anniversary Foil Villain Collection"}, {"id": "126951", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Ambuscade Villain Character"}, {"id": "134394", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: America's Greatest Legacy Promo Card"}, {"id": "257509", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Benchmark Hero Character"}, {"id": "181683", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Chokepoint Villain Character"}, {"id": "191287", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Chrono-Ranger \u2013 The Best of Times Promo Card"}, {"id": "195338", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Complete Hero Variant Collection"}, {"id": "126949", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Cosmic Omnitron Villain Promo Card"}, {"id": "134391", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Dark Visionary Promo Card"}, {"id": "151555", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Dark Watch Promo Pack"}, {"id": "207879", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Dice Tower Kickstarter Promo Pack 2016"}, {"id": "309283", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Freedom Five Promo Cards"}, {"id": "134392", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Freedom Six Promo Pack"}, {"id": "146417", "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: G.I.

increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture.\n\nThe central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.\n\nAt the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.\n\nWhat are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you \u2013 and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.\n\nAll game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 14473, "average": 7.76535, "bayesaverage": 7.52564, "stddev": 1.36258, "median": 0.0, "owned": 16847, "trading": 267, "wanting": 961, "wishing": 4198, "numcomments": 2687, "numweights": 838, "averageweight": 3.6527, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 93}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 73}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 242, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 86}, "2": {"best_rating": 57, "recommended_rating": 132, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "3": {"best_rating": 68, "recommended_rating": 116, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 114, "recommended_rating": 60, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 69}}}, "usersrated": 14473.0, "average": 7.76535, "bayesaverage": 7.52564, "stddev": 1.36258, "median": 0.0, "owned": 16847.0, "trading": 267.0, "wanting": 961.0, "wishing": 4198.0, "numcomments": 2687.0, "numweights": 838.0, "averageweight": 3.6527, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 93}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 73}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "102794", "name": "Caverna: The Cave Farmers", "alternative_names": ["Caverna", "Caverna: Die H\u00f6hlenbauern", "Caverna: il Popolo delle Montagne", "Caverna: Sedl\u00e1ci z jeskyn\u00ed", "Caverna: \u041f\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0444\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b", "Kawerna: Rolnicy z Jaski\u0144", "\u30ab\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca: \u6d1e\u7a9f\u306e\u8fb2\u592b\u305f\u3061", "\u6d1e\u7a74\u8fb2\u592b", "\u6d1e\u7a74\u8fb2\u592b", "\uce74\ubca0\ub974\ub098: \ub3d9\uad74 \uc18d \ub18d\ubd80\ub4e4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rz22tqa5PCYvK9oDjIbvxg__thumb/img/3Ae-ieYpDv6w0vuNsGjOmXdcCrU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1790789.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rz22tqa5PCYvK9oDjIbvxg__original/img/xLuIh5VNsD57GXfcBox_ZF1jH4o=/0x0/pic1790789.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Cattle / Cows", "Animals: Dogs", "Animals: Donkeys", "Animals: Sheep", "Components: Meeples (Animal) / Animeeples", "Game: Caverna (Uwe Rosenberg)", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg)", "Theme: Mining"], "categories": ["Animals", "Economic", "Fantasy", "Farming"], "implementations": ["Caverna: Cave vs Cave", "Agricola"], "mechanics": ["Automatic Resource Growth", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tile Placement", "Turn Order: Claim Action", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Javier Gonz\u00e1lez Cava", "Klemens Franz"], "publishers": ["Lookout Games", "999 Games", "CrowD Games", "Devir", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Funforge", "Gemenot", "Hobby Japan", "HomoLudicus", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lacerta", "Ludofy Creative", "Mayfair Games", "MINDOK", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "uplay.it edizioni"], "description": "Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.\n\nIt's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.\n\nYou can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.\n\nCaverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "154204", "name": "Caverna: Christmas Chamber"}, {"id": "160803", "name": "Caverna: LARP and Cosplay Postcard"}, {"id": "166187", "name": "Caverna: Mini Expansion"}, {"id": "245932", "name": "Caverna: The Forgotten Folk"}, {"id": "272699", "name": "Caverna: The Forgotten Folk \u2013 Adventurers Promo"}, {"id": "248951", "name": "Caverna: The Forgotten Folk \u2013 Halflings promo"}, {"id": "183531", "name": "Caverna: Water Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 210, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 210, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 27552, "average": 8.02542, "bayesaverage": 7.85435, "stddev": 1.34862, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34643, "trading": 422, "wanting": 1750, "wishing": 10177, "numcomments": 4510, "numweights": 1426, "averageweight": 3.7847, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 28}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 25}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 444, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 154, "not_recommended_rating": 104}, "2": {"best_rating": 61, "recommended_rating": 237, "not_recommended_rating": 44}, "3": {"best_rating": 151, "recommended_rating": 200, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "4": {"best_rating": 235, "recommended_rating": 125, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "5": {"best_rating": 77, "recommended_rating": 176, "not_recommended_rating": 74}, "6": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 101, "not_recommended_rating": 179}, "7": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 51, "not_recommended_rating": 231}, "7+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 193}}}, "usersrated": 27552.0, "average": 8.02542, "bayesaverage": 7.85435, "stddev": 1.34862, "median": 0.0, "owned": 34643.0, "trading": 422.0, "wanting": 1750.0, "wishing": 10177.0, "numcomments": 4510.0, "numweights": 1426.0, "averageweight": 3.7847, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 28}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 25}], "game_family": "Caverna (Uwe Rosenberg)", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "7854", "name": "YINSH", "alternative_names": ["\uc778\uc26c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a9Dco_g83IUWxrpxsw8ibw__thumb/img/2JsnDtb5luvivTuwyHdEkGkxyNs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2844830.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a9Dco_g83IUWxrpxsw8ibw__original/img/r6HwrW73OhVv9TshlnWoQ96b-d8=/0x0/pic2844830.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Misc: Mensa Select", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Series: GIPF Project"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Pattern Building"], "designers": ["Kris Burm"], "artists": ["Kris Burm", "lu'cifer"], "publishers": ["Don & Co.", "DiceTree Games", "HUCH!", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Rio Grande Games", "Smart Toys and Games, Inc."], "description": "In YINSH, the players each start with five rings on the board.

If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game.

The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment Mars Base Camp, private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony. As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company\u2019s private agenda.\n\nIn the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet's surface. As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food \u2014 the necessities for survival.\n\nDo you dare take part in humankind\u2019s biggest challenge?\n\nOn Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase \u00e2\u20ac\u2039and the Shuttle Phase\u00e2\u20ac\u2039.\n\nDuring the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet\u2019s surface with your rover. In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.\n\nAll buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony\u2019s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.\n\nDuring the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "278431", "name": "On Mars: Beacon Promo Card"}, {"id": "278241", "name": "On Mars: Surviving Mars \u2013 The Cooperative Expansion for On Mars"}, {"id": "296981", "name": "On Mars: Upgrade Pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2020, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 150, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 150, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 5106, "average": 8.30469, "bayesaverage": 7.59065, "stddev": 1.49423, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9589, "trading": 70, "wanting": 635, "wishing": 4318, "numcomments": 1095, "numweights": 774, "averageweight": 4.6189, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 73}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 45}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 199, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 69, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "2": {"best_rating": 28, "recommended_rating": 119, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "3": {"best_rating": 103, "recommended_rating": 44, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4": {"best_rating": 40, "recommended_rating": 71, "not_recommended_rating": 33}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 84}}}, "usersrated": 5106.0, "average": 8.30469, "bayesaverage": 7.59065, "stddev": 1.49423, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9589.0, "trading": 70.0, "wanting": 635.0, "wishing": 4318.0, "numcomments": 1095.0, "numweights": 774.0, "averageweight": 4.6189, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 73}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 45}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "185343", "name": "Anachrony", "alternative_names": ["Anachrony Essential Edition", "\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c", "\u30a2\u30ca\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30fc", "\u65f6\u7a7a\u9519\u4e71", "\u6642\u7a7a\u4e82\u5e8f", "\uc544\ub098\ud06c\ub85c\ub2c8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__thumb/img/a0G93aMOKp3_mmnCURYWuZd210U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499707.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__original/img/HwoXcAIvX44tc_CDgcQ6I0Rztg8=/0x0/pic3499707.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Anachrony", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Time Travel"], "categories": ["Economic", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tug of War", "Turn Order: Claim Action", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement", "Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"], "designers": ["D\u00e1vid Turczi", "Richard Amann", "Viktor Peter"], "artists": ["Vill\u0151 Farkas", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fejes", "Laslo Forgach", "M\u00e1rton Gyula Kiss", "P\u00e9ter Meszl\u00e9nyi"], "publishers": ["Mindclash Games", "Albi", "Albi Polska", "Angry Lion Games", "CrowD Games", "Engames", "Games Warehouse", "Maldito Games", "MYBG Co., Ltd."], "description": "It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.\n\nBy powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...\n\nAnachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them \u2014 and both are in short supply.\n\nThe game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs \u2014 unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past \"self\" with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "297528", "name": "Anachrony: Classic Expansion Pack"}, {"id": "211238", "name": "Anachrony: Doomsday Enhancement Pack"}, {"id": "218791", "name": "Anachrony: Exosuit Commander Pack"}, {"id": "272077", "name": "Anachrony: Fractures of Time"}, {"id": "286574", "name": "Anachrony: Future Imperfect"}, {"id": "283833", "name": "Anachrony: The Board Game Spotlight Promos"}, {"id": "283832", "name": "Anachrony: The Secret Cabal 2019 Promo Cards"}, {"id": "266237", "name": "Anachrony: The Sentry Post"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 15, "stats": {"usersrated": 10892, "average": 8.07803, "bayesaverage": 7.69987, "stddev": 1.39485, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14466, "trading": 96, "wanting": 1012, "wishing": 5658, "numcomments": 2052, "numweights": 589, "averageweight": 3.9881, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 49}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 38}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 205, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 89, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "2": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 119, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "3": {"best_rating": 118, "recommended_rating": 46, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 93}}}, "usersrated": 10892.0, "average": 8.07803, "bayesaverage": 7.69987, "stddev": 1.39485, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14466.0, "trading": 96.0, "wanting": 1012.0, "wishing": 5658.0, "numcomments": 2052.0, "numweights": 589.0, "averageweight": 3.9881, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 49}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 38}], "game_family": "Anachrony", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "104006", "name": "Village", "alternative_names": ["Descendance", "Het Dorp", "Kronika panstv\u00ed", "Pokolenia", "La Villa", "Village: Cronica genera\u021biilor", "Village: La Vita \u00e8 un Gioco", "Village: Nemzed\u00e9kek j\u00e1t\u00e9ka", "Village: \u039f \u039a\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0396\u03c9\u03ae\u03c2", "\u041b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c", "\u0421\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435", "\u6751\u306e\u4eba\u751f", "\u6751\u838a"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__thumb/img/5H-bOQSAtO8LaWI3i3_oG3CQHHg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2760568.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__original/img/XJ9DcBvOYgoSSNLjx0GP4If8hms=/0x0/pic2760568.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Village"], "categories": ["Farming", "Medieval"], "implementations": ["My Village"], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Area Majority / Influence", "Contracts", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement", "Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"], "designers": ["Inka Brand", "Markus Brand"], "artists": ["Dennis Lohausen"], "publishers": ["eggertspiele", "999 Games", "Albi", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Fantasmagoria", "Fire on Board Jogos", "Gigamic", "hobbity.eu", "Hobby Japan", "KADABRA", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Lautapelit.fi", "Ludicus", "Ludonova", "Pegasus Spiele", "Plan B Games", "Stronghold Games", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Tasty Minstrel Games", "uplay.it edizioni", "Zvezda"], "description": "Game description from the publisher:\n\nLife in the village is hard \u2013 but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please. One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.\n\nEach player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways.

The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "293240", "name": "Super Power"}, {"id": "124118", "name": "Village: Customer Expansion"}, {"id": "166592", "name": "Village: Customer Expansion 2"}, {"id": "136223", "name": "Village: Inn"}, {"id": "155996", "name": "Village: Port"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 19948, "average": 7.52765, "bayesaverage": 7.36058, "stddev": 1.18774, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25935, "trading": 414, "wanting": 686, "wishing": 3646, "numcomments": 3273, "numweights": 1079, "averageweight": 3.0714, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 154}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 116}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 297, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 140}, "2": {"best_rating": 33, "recommended_rating": 171, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "3": {"best_rating": 83, "recommended_rating": 146, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 182, "recommended_rating": 62, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 105}}}, "usersrated": 19948.0, "average": 7.52765, "bayesaverage": 7.36058, "stddev": 1.18774, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25935.0, "trading": 414.0, "wanting": 686.0, "wishing": 3646.0, "numcomments": 3273.0, "numweights": 1079.0, "averageweight": 3.0714, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 154}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 116}], "game_family": "Village", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "104162", "name": "Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)", "alternative_names": ["Descent: Die Reise ins Dunkel (Zweite Edition)", "Descent: Viaggi nelle Tenebre (Seconda Edizione)", "Descent: Viaje a las Tinieblas (Segunda Edici\u00f3n)", "Descent: Voyages dans les T\u00e9n\u00e8bres (Seconde edition)", "Descent: V\u00fdpravy do temnot (druh\u00e1 edice)", "Descent: W\u0119dr\u00f3wki w mroku (Druga edycja)", "Descent: \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e \u0422\u044c\u043c\u0435 (\u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f)", "Odalent: Kalandok a m\u00e9lyben", "\u30c7\u30a3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u7b2c\uff12\u7248 \u301c\u95c7\u4e16\u754c\u3078\u306e\u65c5\u7acb\u3061\u301c", "\u6df1\u5165\u7d55\u5730\uff1a\u6697\u9ed1\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u65c5\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7248 (\u7e41\u9ad4\u7248)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZN2rpiJ19lg5DZk_iYMMkQ__thumb/img/C6XETjkjDq3zebWc7-Rf_WKh2ak=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1180640.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZN2rpiJ19lg5DZk_iYMMkQ__original/img/jGVm6aG5Ek-qxTIaWyzN67jjylc=/0x0/pic1180640.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler", "Components: Miniatures", "Creatures: Monsters", "Game: Descent \u2013 Journeys in the Dark", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Players: One versus Many", "Setting: The Realms of Terrinoth"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "implementations": ["Star Wars: Imperial Assault", "Descent: Journeys in the Dark"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Line of Sight", "Modular Board", "Movement Points", "Multiple Maps", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Daniel Clark (I)", "Corey Konieczka", "Adam Sadler", "Kevin Wilson"], "artists": ["Alex Aparin", "Devon Caddy-Lee", "Sylvain Decaux", "Tod Gelle", "Charl\u00e8ne le Scanff", "Thomas Lishman", "Henning Ludvigsen", "Dallas Mehlhoff", "Allison Theus", "Sandara Tang Sin Yun"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Arclight", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "description": "In Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition), one player takes on the role of the treacherous overlord, and up to four other players take on the roles of courageous heroes.

For such times, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system. Players build their dice pools according to their character's abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways.

And with the horrors awaiting you beneath the surface, you'll need every advantage you can take...\n\nFeaturing double-sided modular board pieces, countless hero and skill combinations, and an immersive story-driven campaign, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) transports heroes to a vibrant fantasy realm where they must stand together against an ancient evil.\n\nCompared to the first edition of Descent: Journeys in the Dark, this game features:\n\n\n     Simpler rules for determining line of sight \n     Faster setup of each encounter\n     Defense dice to mitigate the

King Charles will make it the capital of an empire!\n\nIn Praga Caput Regni, players take the role of wealthy citizens who are organizing various building projects in medieval Prague.

Players choose from six actions on the game board \u2014 the \"action crane\" \u2014 that are always available, but which are weighted with a constantly shifting array of costs and benefits.

Western histories often call this period \"The Great Game\" because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.\n\nIn terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.\n\nTo survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a \"Dominance Check\", is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.\n\nAfter each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 3518, "average": 8.43336, "bayesaverage": 7.49931, "stddev": 1.41037, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7210, "trading": 32, "wanting": 590, "wishing": 2555, "numcomments": 930, "numweights": 222, "averageweight": 3.7387, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 100}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 6}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 50}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 160, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 75, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "2": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 31}, "3": {"best_rating": 58, "recommended_rating": 64, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 90, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 70, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 72}}}, "usersrated": 3518.0, "average": 8.43336, "bayesaverage": 7.49931, "stddev": 1.41037, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7210.0, "trading": 32.0, "wanting": 590.0, "wishing": 2555.0, "numcomments": 930.0, "numweights": 222.0, "averageweight": 3.7387, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 100}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 6}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 50}], "game_family": "Pax Pamir", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "175155", "name": "Forbidden Stars", "alternative_names": ["Verbotene Welten", "Zakazane Gwiazdy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WlvyznYhlYNXMtMbKKu1oA__thumb/img/cudczHrJs0wFKywIHBQ6Fb7D7oY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2471359.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WlvyznYhlYNXMtMbKKu1oA__original/img/DWTv4PxEDiHHmgnv09t4k2WmNh8=/0x0/pic2471359.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Setting: Warhammer 40,000 Board Games"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "implementations": ["StarCraft: The Board Game"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Card Play Conflict Resolution", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Order Counters", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Samuel Bailey", "James Kniffen", "Corey Konieczka"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "Asterion Press", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag"], "description": "The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.\n\nForbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same \u2014 to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes \u2014 or they will do the same to you.\n\nEach round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:\n\n\n     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources\n     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities\n     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units\n     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.\n\n\nThe last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.\n\nBecause of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 7359, "average": 7.96916, "bayesaverage": 7.48565, "stddev": 1.44536, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11724, "trading": 254, "wanting": 710, "wishing": 3221, "numcomments": 1387, "numweights": 379, "averageweight": 3.8259, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 104}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 75}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 260, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 155}, "2": {"best_rating": 111, "recommended_rating": 96, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "3": {"best_rating": 123, "recommended_rating": 83, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4": {"best_rating": 65, "recommended_rating": 81, "not_recommended_rating": 63}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 132}}}, "usersrated": 7359.0, "average": 7.96916, "bayesaverage": 7.48565, "stddev": 1.44536, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11724.0, "trading": 254.0, "wanting": 710.0, "wishing": 3221.0, "numcomments": 1387.0, "numweights": 379.0, "averageweight": 3.8259, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 104}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 75}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "175324", "name": "Fog of Love", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q8impbJrOxmhzZbLTOnlZg__thumb/img/YOiFshgqroec7WqlRYRtwooq8zk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3726790.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q8impbJrOxmhzZbLTOnlZg__original/img/OyQXeAnPK2fohsIq-Pu0n-5HJeo=/0x0/pic3726790.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Contests: Fastaval Design Competition", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Fog of Love", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Theme: Love / Romance", "Theme: Queer / LGBTAIQ"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Hand Management", "Role Playing", "Simulation", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Storytelling"], "designers": ["Jacob Jaskov"], "artists": ["Cecilie Fossheim", "Mike H\u00f8jgaard", "Lotte M.

Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.\n\nNo two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.\n\nA round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.\n\nAfter every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "315895", "name": "Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition \u2013 Prophecy of Kings"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 480, "minplaytime": 240, "maxplaytime": 480, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 12685, "average": 8.69462, "bayesaverage": 8.23882, "stddev": 1.5979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15806, "trading": 79, "wanting": 951, "wishing": 7680, "numcomments": 2013, "numweights": 586, "averageweight": 4.2235, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 5}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 3}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 4}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 297, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 214}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 210}, "3": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 134, "not_recommended_rating": 97}, "4": {"best_rating": 74, "recommended_rating": 145, "not_recommended_rating": 41}, "5": {"best_rating": 49, "recommended_rating": 175, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "6": {"best_rating": 215, "recommended_rating": 40, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 129}}}, "usersrated": 12685.0, "average": 8.69462, "bayesaverage": 8.23882, "stddev": 1.5979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15806.0, "trading": 79.0, "wanting": 951.0, "wishing": 7680.0, "numcomments": 2013.0, "numweights": 586.0, "averageweight": 4.2235, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 5}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 3}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 4}], "game_family": "Twilight Imperium", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "233312", "name": "Stuffed Fables", "alternative_names": ["F\u00e1bulas de Peluche", "Fiabe di Stoffa", "Der Herr der Tr\u00e4ume", "Der Herr der Tr\u00e4ume: Die Stoffi Chroniken", "Histoires de Peluches", "Pl\u00fcssmes\u00e9k", "Pluszowe Opowie\u015bci", "Ply\u0161ov\u00e1 hl\u00eddka", "\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0438", "\u73a9\u5076\u9a91\u58eb\u56e2"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CS83e1WOA5WMc4izRw6zwg__thumb/img/S8F7Wyt0tUKzok9xKx4-f4IegRE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3708878.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CS83e1WOA5WMc4izRw6zwg__original/img/_qm1FBu5oN7XcONKTjUR1fz7ja8=/0x0/pic3708878.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler", "Components: Book as Board", "Components: Miniatures", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Series: AdventureBook Games (Plaid Hat)"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Animals"], "implementations": ["Comanauts"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Role Playing", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Jerry Hawthorne"], "artists": ["Kendall Wilkerson", "Kristen Pauline", "Tregis"], "publishers": ["Plaid Hat Games", "Asmodee", "Asmodee Italia", "CrowD Games", "Cube Factory of Ideas", "Edge Entertainment", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "MINDOK", "Playfun Games", "Purple Meeple Games"], "description": "Stuffed Fables is an unusual adventure game in which players take on the roles of brave stuffies seeking to save the child they love from a scheming, evil mastermind.

Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks. Players can store dice for later, combine dice for stronger actions, or use them one-at-a-time for multiple activations. As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!\n\nPlayers can encourage each other by sharing dice or their precious stuffing. In addition to fighting minions, each page of the storybook offers numerous points of interest, charming characters to interact or trade with, as well as many unusual challenges. And each page is but one chapter that folds into a branching, overarching story with a multitude of items and a special discovery deck full of surprises.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "326199", "name": "Stuffed Fables: Oh, Brother!

Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire\u2019s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.\n\nImperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You\u2019ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you\u2019ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.\n\nAs an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.\n\nWith these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "194901", "name": "Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Agent Blaise Villain Pack"},

Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to neutralize enemy agents, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth.\n\nCombatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it's not the only threat you'll encounter in the field. Enemy agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it's critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won't be without backup. Coordinate with other covert operatives for assistance and make strategic use of these teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives.\n\nDesigned as a prequel, Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 does not require you to have completed Season 1 and Season 2 before diving into this Cold War spy thriller. As in the first two Pandemic Legacy games, each time you play brings new cards, rules, and conditions that affect future games. Each alias you create will gain contacts and other assets to execute your plans more smoothly. And, of course, the CIA will be watching and evaluating your performance in the field.

Betrayal Legacy consists of a prologue and a thirteen-chapter story that takes place over decades. Players represent families, with specific members of a family participating in one story, then perhaps an older version of those characters (assuming they lived) or their descendants showing up in later stories.\n\nWhy would people keep exploring a haunted mansion for decade after decade, especially when horrible things happen there? Curiosity, I suppose, or perhaps an ignorant boldness that comes from the belief that we know better than those who have come before. Look at all that we've learned, marvel at the tools we have at hand! Surely we'll all exit safely this time...\n\nAs with other Betrayal titles, the game is narratively-driven, with elements that record the history of your specific games.

Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\n\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\n\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added.

Magazine's Manager of the Year!\n\nOnce a manager has chosen one of the six teams, he has five weeks to groom them into the best in the league, culminating with the Blood Bowl tournament. He does this by competing at highlights, collecting payouts, upgrading his personnel, and drafting Star Players.\n\nManagers begin the season with a starting team deck full of basic scrub players. These players are none too bright and have limited talents, but a clever manager can play to their strengths by carefully positioning them to excel on the pitch.\n\nIs your team ready to compete against other teams in head-to-head highlights?

This game is unrelated to the similarly named 2002 Eagle Games Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame.\n\nFrom Press Release:\n\nBefore you lies a vast bounty of land, ripe for the plucking. Your meager beginnings will influence the paths you must take. Lead your people well and they will take you to infinite heights of greatness. If civilization manages to endure the ages, your name will hang in every whisper of its legacy...\n\nFantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: The Board Game! Forge an empire to stand the test of time using innovative game mechanics with multiple paths to victory.\n\nWill you lead the greatest army in the world to conquer your foes? Or will you be the first to journey to the stars, becoming the most technologically advanced civilization known to man? The choice is yours.\n\nDesigned by Kevin Wilson, Civilization: The Board Game is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people\u2019s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.\n\nIn Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!\n\nFans of Sid Meier\u2019s classic video game franchise will find familiar footing in Civilization: The Board Game. Staying true to the foundations of its video game predecessor while creating a new and unique way to play, Civilization: The Board Game captures the spirit and grandeur of carving out a magnificent empire from modest beginnings.\n\nPlayers start off with a single city, one army figure, and one scout, and from these meager origins you must forge through the ages and become the greatest civilization in the world.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the video game series will find Civilization: The Board Game a great way to enter into the world of Civilization. The strategy and tactical decisions involved in Civilization: The Board Game will appeal to strategy gamers and war gamers alike, and the ability to win through culture and technological advancement will give those who only wish to focus on their own empire a chance at victory as well.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "155127", "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game \u2013 die Griechen Promo Card"}, {"id": "108415", "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game \u2013 Fame and Fortune"}, {"id": "142708", "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game \u2013 Wisdom and Warfare"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 240, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 240, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 14295, "average": 7.41481, "bayesaverage": 7.17194, "stddev": 1.48951, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19124, "trading": 718, "wanting": 396, "wishing": 2941, "numcomments": 2598, "numweights": 1070, "averageweight": 3.8869, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 249}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 182}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 333, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 161}, "2": {"best_rating": 25, "recommended_rating": 162, "not_recommended_rating": 72}, "3": {"best_rating": 55, "recommended_rating": 185, "not_recommended_rating": 23}, "4": {"best_rating": 229, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4+": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 104}}}, "usersrated": 14295.0, "average": 7.41481, "bayesaverage": 7.17194, "stddev": 1.48951, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19124.0, "trading": 718.0, "wanting": 396.0, "wishing": 2941.0, "numcomments": 2598.0, "numweights": 1070.0, "averageweight": 3.8869, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 249}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 182}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "77423", "name": "The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game", "alternative_names": ["Der Herr der Ringe: Das Kartenspiel", "P\u00e1n prsten\u016f: Karetn\u00ed hra", "Le Seigneur des Anneaux: Le jeu de cartes", "O Senhor dos An\u00e9is: Card Game", "El Se\u00f1or de los Anillos: El Juego de Cartas", "Il Signore degli Anelli: Il Gioco di Carte", "W\u0142adca Pier\u015bcieni: Gra Karciana", "\u039f \u0386\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0394\u03b1\u03c7\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd", "\u9b54\u6212\uff1a\u5361\u724c\u7248"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZmXi5BbtoWl58ZnKcUy1vw__thumb/img/__NGanznvqHKTFhj28S8ZpfLbpc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic906495.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZmXi5BbtoWl58ZnKcUy1vw__original/img/TdAxQnbevAwD1oQ91K1KPckgjTk=/0x0/pic906495.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Authors: J.R.R.

Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.\n\nAlthough this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.\n\nThe scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign.\n\nMicrobadge: \n\n", "expansions":

Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon. The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated \u2014 but a player can lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.\n\nPlaying Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.\n\nPlayers interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed), this means that every \"build phase\" is a bidding war. Spells are instant-speed effects that can give players advantages or disrupt opponents.\n\nAs a standalone card game with 155 cards, Boss Monster contains everything that 2-4 players need to play.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "158845", "name": "Boss Monster: Bast Promo Card"}, {"id": "158933", "name": "Boss Monster: Bastas Promo Card"}, {"id": "164723", "name": "Boss Monster: Bom-Boy Factory Promo Card"}, {"id": "194669", "name": "Boss Monster: Collector Box"}, {"id": "202831", "name": "Boss Monster: Crash Landing"}, {"id": "133778", "name": "Boss Monster: Creator Pack"}, {"id": "133780", "name": "Boss Monster: Epic Multi Heroes"}, {"id": "206997", "name": "Boss Monster: Final Form!

Players are builders who try to contribute the most to this cathedral's construction and, in so doing, score the most victory points.  Gameplay roughly consists of using workers to produce raw materials, and then using craftsmen to convert the materials into victory points.  Workers may also be used to produce gold, the currency of the game.  Players are also given three master builders each turn, each of which can do a variety of tasks, including recruiting more workers, buying or selling goods, or just obtaining victory points.  Getting early choices with a master builder costs gold, as does purchasing better craftsmen.  Players must strike a balance between earning gold to fund their purchases and earning victory points.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n\n     The Pillars of the Earth Expansion Set (which include the Expansion Cards in some editions)\n     The Pillars of the Earth: Expansion Cards (which are included in the Expansion Set in some editions)\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "31753", "name": "The Pillars of the Earth: Expansion Set"}, {"id": "33559", "name": "The Pillars of the Earth: New Craftsmen"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2006, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 16168, "average": 7.29103, "bayesaverage": 7.11339, "stddev": 1.19339, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19620, "trading": 535, "wanting": 737, "wishing": 3664, "numcomments": 3553, "numweights": 1361, "averageweight": 2.82, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 291}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 213}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 297, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 150}, "2": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 126, "not_recommended_rating": 85}, "3": {"best_rating": 89, "recommended_rating": 147, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "4": {"best_rating": 167, "recommended_rating": 70, "not_recommended_rating": 19}, "4+": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 110}}}, "usersrated": 16168.0, "average": 7.29103, "bayesaverage": 7.11339, "stddev": 1.19339, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19620.0, "trading": 535.0, "wanting": 737.0, "wishing": 3664.0, "numcomments": 3553.0, "numweights": 1361.0, "averageweight": 2.82, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 291}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 213}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "295770", "name": "Frosthaven", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cwUgf-f-qwri8UHBUnifuQ__thumb/img/3o2Hc_N5mmfpOt8s9kP0ap8Jti8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5092291.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cwUgf-f-qwri8UHBUnifuQ__original/img/wPYpV_ug_671ykx_tGTJcwHPaE0=/0x0/pic5092291.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Category: Dungeon Crawler", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Gloomhaven", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Mechanism: Legacy", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Cooperative Game", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Legacy Game", "Modular Board", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Isaac Childres"], "artists": ["David Demaret", "Alexandr Elichev", "Josh T.

There, a group of mercenaries at the end of their rope will help bring back this settlement from the edge of destruction.\n\nNot only will they have to deal with the harsh elements, but there are other, far more dangerous threats out in the unforgiving cold as well. There are Algox, the bigger, more yeti-like cousins of the Inox, attacking from the mountains; Lurkers flooding in from the northern sea; and rumors of machines that wander the frozen wastes of their own free will. The party of mercenaries must face all of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they can work together against even more sinister forces.\n\nFrosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign.\n\nIn addition to having the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven will feature much more to do outside of combat, such as numerous mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how this ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.\n\nCharacters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa:\n\nAs revealed during PAX 2020, Frosthaven will be interchangeable with the original Gloomhaven board game. To an extent, anyway. Namely, you can use Gloomhaven's characters in Frosthaven and vice versa. What's more, some of the first game's items will become available throughout the sequel.\n\nFrosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanic for bringing items over from 'Gloomhaven'. However, as it is a remote location, these products get imported and are not there as standard. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buy them.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "306151", "name": "Frosthaven: Solo Scenarios"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2021, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 338, "average": 7.15594, "bayesaverage": 5.69175, "stddev": 3.75033, "median": 0.0, "owned": 799, "trading": 4, "wanting": 100, "wishing": 2189, "numcomments": 401, "numweights": 32, "averageweight": 3.2812, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4884}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1634}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 9, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 5}}}, "usersrated": 338.0, "average": 7.15594, "bayesaverage": 5.69175, "stddev": 3.75033, "median": 0.0, "owned": 799.0, "trading": 4.0, "wanting": 100.0, "wishing": 2189.0, "numcomments": 401.0, "numweights": 32.0, "averageweight": 3.2812, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4884}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1634}], "game_family": "Gloomhaven", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "171131", "name": "Captain Sonar", "alternative_names": ["Capit\u00e1n Sonar", "Polaris", "\u041a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0421\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440", "\u6df1\u6d77\u8adc\u5f71"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eVy9IyAVtzzKv2VvPHFPbA__thumb/img/RavsPCF6el7VEaVR1OG5M2ZGCrk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3013621.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eVy9IyAVtzzKv2VvPHFPbA__original/img/rVAq1lKg98oU6tvLjERL-ZNiMfc=/0x0/pic3013621.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Captain Sonar", "Mechanism: Hidden Movement", "Theme: Submarines"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Fighting", "Nautical", "Real-time"], "implementations": ["Sonar"], "mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Hidden Movement", "Line Drawing", "Real-Time", "Role Playing", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": ["Roberto Fraga", "Yohan Lemonnier"], "artists": ["Ervin", "Sabrina Tobal"], "publishers": ["Matagot", "Asmodee", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Bureau de Juegos", "Conclave Editora", "CrowD Games", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Lex Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "Pendragon Game Studio", "Surfin' Meeple China"], "description": "At the bottom of the ocean, no one will hear you scream!\n\nIn Captain Sonar, you and your teammates control a state-of-the-art submarine and are trying to locate an enemy submarine in order to blow it out of the water before they can do the same to you.

You will earn money and prestige by building the biggest and most profitable casinos on \"The Strip,\" the town's backbone of dust and sin. You start with nothing but parking lots and dreams, but from there you build, sprawl, reorganize and gamble your way to victory. Score the most points investing in the most profitable development companies and putting the best bosses in control of the richest casinos. Put your dollars on the line . . . it's time to roll!\n\nThe game board is broken into 8 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty 'lots'. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and VP. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. VP goes only to the casino's owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents' casinos to make more money. Ultimately, though, only victory points matter, and that means making yourself boss of the biggest casinos.\n\nLords of Vegas contains: \n\n    Snazzy game board \n    4 turn summaries \n    55 cards \n    40 chips in 4 colors \n    48 dice in 4 colors \n    4 poker chips \n    Lots of money \n    45 casino blocks \n    Rules \n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "148572", "name": "Lords of Vegas: Mob Rules & Union of the Shakes"}, {"id": "130466", "name": "Lords of Vegas: Sky Bridge / Building Boom"}, {"id": "306445", "name": "Lords of Vegas: Underworld"}, {"id": "308068", "name": "Lords of Vegas: Underworld \u2013 Vegas Shutdown Promo Card"}, {"id": "151464", "name": "Lords of Vegas: UP!"}, {"id": "144851", "name": "Mayfair Game Variants & Mini-Expansions Set #1"}, {"id": "142993", "name": "Mayfair Game Variants & Mini-Expansions Set #2"}, {"id": "169757", "name": "Mayfair Games' Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #13"}, {"id": "151123", "name": "Mayfair Games' Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #7"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 6418, "average": 7.32922, "bayesaverage": 6.9688, "stddev": 1.3983, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8393, "trading": 130, "wanting": 679, "wishing": 2388, "numcomments": 1464, "numweights": 267, "averageweight": 2.3558, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 410}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 110}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 265}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 90, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "3": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 27}}}, "usersrated": 6418.0, "average": 7.32922, "bayesaverage": 6.9688, "stddev": 1.3983, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8393.0, "trading": 130.0, "wanting": 679.0, "wishing": 2388.0, "numcomments": 1464.0, "numweights": 267.0, "averageweight": 2.3558, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 410}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 110}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 265}], "game_family": "Lords of Vegas", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "35677", "name": "Le Havre", "alternative_names": ["\u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440", "\u30eb\u30fb\u30a2\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb", "\u6e2f\u90fd\u60c5\u6fc3", "\ub974 \uc544\ube0c\ub974"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mU-YdL_-3Fm4RvNv-y5WJg__thumb/img/mU1YYormB7n6q6y1mUueZp1mSo0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3330230.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mU-YdL_-3Fm4RvNv-y5WJg__original/img/Fs2MqRUBPQzORmEZbiVqSnBvHDg=/0x0/pic3330230.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: Le Havre (France)", "Country: France", "Game: Le Havre", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Region: Normandy (France)", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg)"], "categories": ["City Building", "Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Nautical"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Automatic Resource Growth", "End Game Bonuses", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Loans", "Ownership", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz"], "publishers": ["Lookout Games", "999 Games", "CrowD Games", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "GoKids \u73a9\u6a02\u5c0f\u5b50", "Hobby Japan", "HomoLudicus", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lacerta", "Ludofy Creative", "Maldito Games", "Mayfair Games", "MINDOK", "Stratelibri", "uplay.it edizioni", "Ystari Games", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "In Le Havre, a player's turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action.

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.\n\nHistory of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.\n\nMany books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of \"Vacations\" from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called \"ACQUIRE.\" 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had taken liberties with some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.\n\nDecember 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition\n1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay & stocks with printed backs\n1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay & stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)\n1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay & non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)\n1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)\n1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board\n1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company\n1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       & 86)\n1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)\n1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions\n1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro\n1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks & money, large info cards\n2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast\n2006 - Lloyd's Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas \n2008 - Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board & tiles, redesigned stocks & money\n2016 - Dated 2016 The current affordable mass-market edition. It looks at first sight to be similar to previous modern editions, but has been criticised for the use of inferior design choices such as hard-to-read grey-on-grey embossed slots and the unusual tile fonts. It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "323173", "name": "Wild Tile Variant Kit for the Game of ACQUIRE"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1964, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 18046, "average": 7.3406, "bayesaverage": 7.15533, "stddev": 1.33581, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22896, "trading": 873, "wanting": 528, "wishing": 2570, "numcomments": 5720, "numweights": 1598, "averageweight": 2.5044, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 266}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 204}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 322, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 191}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 41, "not_recommended_rating": 192}, "3": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 162, "not_recommended_rating": 44}, "4": {"best_rating": 209, "recommended_rating": 86, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 82, "recommended_rating": 154, "not_recommended_rating": 30}, "6": {"best_rating": 33, "recommended_rating": 112, "not_recommended_rating": 94}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 155}}}, "usersrated": 18046.0, "average": 7.3406, "bayesaverage": 7.15533, "stddev": 1.33581, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22896.0, "trading": 873.0, "wanting": 528.0, "wishing": 2570.0, "numcomments": 5720.0, "numweights": 1598.0, "averageweight": 2.5044, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 266}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 204}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "11", "name": "Bohnanza", "alternative_names": ["Babsz\u00fcret", "Bohnanza Pocket-Version", "Bohnanza \u03a6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03a6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9", "Bohnanza+", "Bohnanza: Fan Edition", "Bohnanza: Ich glaub' es hackt!", "Bohnanza: Jubil\u00e4umsedition", "Bohnanza: Le Business des Haricots", "Bohnanza: Por um Punhado de Feij\u00f5es!", "Bohnanza: \u03a6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03af \u03c4\u03bf \u03a6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9", "Bohnanza: \u03a6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03a6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9...", "Bohnil\u00e4um", "Bonanza", "Boonanza", "Fasolki", "Fazole", "Semenza", "\u0411\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0430", "\u30dc\u30fc\u30ca\u30f3\u30b6", "\u7a2e\u8c46", "\ubcf4\ub09c\uc790"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hTK_hi_S0RvDRuZKyNEgvQ__thumb/img/laOeOkZJnxHAmCPp7OCg66Xd-zY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic69366.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hTK_hi_S0RvDRuZKyNEgvQ__original/img/Hwyjq4cYfXY2l07Hm9mncHlrI4U=/0x0/pic69366.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards", "Game: Bohnanza", "Series: Bean Games (Lookout)"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Farming", "Negotiation"], "implementations": ["Bohn to Be Wild!", "Bohnanza (with Erdn\u00fcsse)", "Bohnanza Fun & Easy", "Bohnanza: 20 Jahre", "Excalibohn", "Ladybohn: Manche m\u00f6gen's heiss!", "Landleven spel", "My First Bohnanza", "Rabohnzel", "Sissi!: Die Bohnenkaiserin", "Wendy Pferdebasar"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Melding and Splaying", "Negotiation", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Fr\u00e9deric Bertrand", "Marek Bl\u00e1ha", "Andrea Boekhoff", "Klemens Franz", "Oliver Freudenreich", "Inge George", "Guido Hoffmann", "Alexander Jung", "Harald Lieske", "Atelier L\u00f6wentor", "Doris Matth\u00e4us", "Bj\u00f6rn Pertoft", "Uwe Rosenberg", "Johann R\u00fcttinger", "Barbara Stachuletz", "Franz Vohwinkel", "Markus Wagner"], "publishers": ["AMIGO", "999 Games", "Br\u00e4dspel.se", "Brain Games", "Copag Cards", "Corfix", "G3", "Gigamic", "Giochi Uniti", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Kikigagne?", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Lookout Games", "Mercurio", "Midgaard Games", "M\u00f6bius Games", "PaperGames (III)", "Piatnik", "Rio Grande Games", "Stratelibri", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Tempo Games"], "description": "Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.\n\nIn the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck \u2014 unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.\n\nOn a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the \"fields\" in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete \u2014 and all trades on a turn must involve the active player \u2014 then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.\n\nWhen you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the \"beanometer\" for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.\n\nThe original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "35589", "name": "Auf der schw\u00e4b'schen Eisenbohn"}, {"id": "103186", "name": "Bohn Camillo"}, {"id": "285164", "name": "Bohna Nostra"}, {"id": "467", "name": "Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set"}, {"id": "1494", "name": "Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set (Revised Edition)"}, {"id": "14118", "name": "Bohnanza: Amigo Bohnentaler"}, {"id": "189272", "name": "Bohnanza: Bean Market"}, {"id": "174239", "name": "Bohnanza: Bohnaparte & High Bohn"}, {"id": "43237", "name": "Bohnanza: Das Fanbuch"}, {"id": "216664", "name": "Bohnanza: Die Jokerbohnen"}, {"id": "168425", "name": "Bohnanza: Princes & Pirates"}, {"id": "35428", "name": "Bohnanza: Spiderbeans"}, {"id": "6264", "name": "Bohnaparte"}, {"id": "59416", "name": "Bohnedikt"}, {"id": "205687", "name": "Bohnedikt (2016 Edition)"}, {"id": "31419", "name": "Bohnr\u00f6schen"}, {"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "8174", "name": "Dschingis Bohn"}, {"id": "111734", "name": "Fasolki: Rozszerzenie"}, {"id": "913", "name": "High Bohn"}, {"id": "12677", "name": "High Bohn Plus"}, {"id": "18793", "name": "High Bohn: Bohnenduell um 12 Uhr mittags"}, {"id": "453", "name": "La Isla Bohnit\u00e2"}, {"id": "4377", "name": "Ladybohn"}, {"id": "243505", "name": "Marco Bohno"}, {"id": "2571", "name": "Mutabohn"}, {"id": "13474", "name": "Telebohn"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1997, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 37656, "average": 7.03624, "bayesaverage": 6.93412, "stddev": 1.29091, "median": 0.0, "owned": 55426, "trading": 988, "wanting": 340, "wishing": 2372, "numcomments": 8437, "numweights": 2776, "averageweight": 1.674, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 443}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 113}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 570, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 351}, "2": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 87, "not_recommended_rating": 327}, "3": {"best_rating": 48, "recommended_rating": 307, "not_recommended_rating": 112}, "4": {"best_rating": 247, "recommended_rating": 238, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "5": {"best_rating": 342, "recommended_rating": 131, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "6": {"best_rating": 144, "recommended_rating": 235, "not_recommended_rating": 48}, "7": {"best_rating": 49, "recommended_rating": 228, "not_recommended_rating": 118}, "7+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 18, "not_recommended_rating": 245}}}, "usersrated": 37656.0, "average": 7.03624, "bayesaverage": 6.93412, "stddev": 1.29091, "median": 0.0, "owned": 55426.0, "trading": 988.0, "wanting": 340.0, "wishing": 2372.0, "numcomments": 8437.0, "numweights": 2776.0, "averageweight": 1.674, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 443}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 113}], "game_family": "Bohnanza", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 27, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "12", "name": "Ra", "alternative_names": ["Reiner Knizia's Ra", "\u30e9\u30fc", "\u592a\u967d\u795e", "\ud0dc\uc591\uc2e0 \ub77c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1m3z3iX0iVtII8AEMuWOeA__thumb/img/qoWgC_i6XctwTIybaqZ8FldYCn0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3013552.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1m3z3iX0iVtII8AEMuWOeA__original/img/iA_LlRmPfFILGon-zvbWeEzxvX8=/0x0/pic3013552.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Egypt", "Game: Ra", "Mythology: Egyptian", "Series: Alea Big Box", "Series: Euro Classics (Reiner Knizia)"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Mythology"], "implementations": ["Priests of Ra", "Ra: The Dice Game", "Razzia!"], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Auction: Once Around", "Closed Economy Auction", "Constrained Bidding", "Push Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "artists": ["Allison Kline", "Franz Vohwinkel"], "publishers": ["alea", "Ravensburger", "25th Century Games", "999 Games", "ABACUSSPIELE", "DiceTree Games", "Edge Entertainment", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "New Games Order, LLC", "Precisamente", "Rio Grande Games", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "\u00dcberplay", "Windrider Games"], "description": "Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.

Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.

(formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.\n\nSetup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\n\nA turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities\u2014think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\n\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\n\nCATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\n\nDie Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "167903", "name": "20 Jahre Darmstadt Spielt"}, {"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)\n\n\n\nIn RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.\n\nIn general, players will first fill all of their robot's \"registers\" with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!\n\nRobots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.\n\nThe game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "1569", "name": "RoboRally: Armed and Dangerous"}, {"id": "1968", "name": "RoboRally: Crash and Burn"}, {"id": "1967", "name": "RoboRally: Grand Prix"}, {"id": "88354", "name": "RoboRally: King of the Hill"}, {"id": "1966", "name": "RoboRally: Radioactive"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1994, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 22308, "average": 7.08405, "bayesaverage": 6.9463, "stddev": 1.53817, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25720, "trading": 691, "wanting": 518, "wishing": 2675, "numcomments": 5439, "numweights": 1709, "averageweight": 2.4301, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 428}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 145}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 319}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 274, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 179}, "2": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 60, "not_recommended_rating": 154}, "3": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 146, "not_recommended_rating": 60}, "4": {"best_rating": 96, "recommended_rating": 127, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "5": {"best_rating": 155, "recommended_rating": 76, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "6": {"best_rating": 151, "recommended_rating": 72, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "7": {"best_rating": 60, "recommended_rating": 114, "not_recommended_rating": 42}, "8": {"best_rating": 55, "recommended_rating": 110, "not_recommended_rating": 49}, "8+": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 121}}}, "usersrated": 22308.0, "average": 7.08405, "bayesaverage": 6.9463, "stddev": 1.53817, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25720.0, "trading": 691.0, "wanting": 518.0, "wishing": 2675.0, "numcomments": 5439.0, "numweights": 1709.0, "averageweight": 2.4301, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 428}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 145}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 319}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "42", "name": "Tigris & Euphrates", "alternative_names": ["Eufraat & Tigris", "Eufraat en Tigris", "Eufrat & Tigris", "Eufrat i Tygrys", "Euphrat & Tigris", "Euphrat und Tigris", "Tigre et Euphrate", "Tigri & Eufrate", "Tigris & Euphrates with Ziggurat Expansion", "Tigris y \u00c9ufrates", "\u0422\u0438\u0433\u0440 \u0438 \u0415\u0432\u0444\u0440\u0430\u0442", "\u30c1\u30b0\u30ea\u30b9\u30fb\u30e6\u30fc\u30d5\u30e9\u30c6\u30b9", "\u4e24\u6cb3\u6d41\u57df", "\u5169\u6cb3\u6d41\u57df", "\ud2f0\uadf8\ub9ac\uc2a4 & \uc720\ud504\ub77c\ud14c\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/soAzNVWglCdVBacNjoCTJw__thumb/img/0UPEyOaSFyqEH1ikrSig_218RQ0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2338267.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/soAzNVWglCdVBacNjoCTJw__original/img/vd6LHDJ-u-TkAAWafD2yG9-U974=/0x0/pic2338267.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Ancient: Mesopotamia", "Game: Tigris & Euphrates", "Region: Middle East", "Rivers: Euphrates", "Rivers: Tigris", "Series: Euro Classics (Reiner Knizia)", "Tile-Laying Trilogy (Reiner Knizia)"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Civilization", "Territory Building"], "implementations": ["Euphrates & Tigris: Contest of Kings", "Yellow & Yangtze"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Hand Management", "Highest-Lowest Scoring", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "artists": ["Bascu", "Christine Conrad", "Doris Matth\u00e4us", "Tom Thiel", "Ricarda Thiel", "Stephen Graham Walsh"], "publishers": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "999 Games", "CZ Cloud Soft Co.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.\n\nStarting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris & Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This \"ziggurat expansion\", initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.\n\nSome versions of Tigris & Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

Bluff, Perudo or Dudo, is a South American dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. \"there are ten sixes\". However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.\n\nAs a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1800, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 12378, "average": 6.9074, "bayesaverage": 6.72975, "stddev": 1.4018, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15840, "trading": 375, "wanting": 126, "wishing": 937, "numcomments": 3600, "numweights": 909, "averageweight": 1.2618, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 666}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 53}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 176}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 185, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 124}, "2": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 28, "not_recommended_rating": 115}, "3": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 84, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "4": {"best_rating": 57, "recommended_rating": 101, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 86, "recommended_rating": 76, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "6": {"best_rating": 113, "recommended_rating": 45, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "6+": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 41, "not_recommended_rating": 52}}}, "usersrated": 12378.0, "average": 6.9074, "bayesaverage": 6.72975, "stddev": 1.4018, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15840.0, "trading": 375.0, "wanting": 126.0, "wishing": 937.0, "numcomments": 3600.0, "numweights": 909.0, "averageweight": 1.2618, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 666}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 53}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 176}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "47", "name": "Chinatown", "alternative_names": ["\u0e44\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e17\u0e32\u0e27\u0e19\u0e4c", "\ucc28\uc774\ub098\ud0c0\uc6b4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QnIOe-1wb8_zuxglKjAwOQ__thumb/img/CyDOXyRu7MHfn2ZS9pb9XmOStv0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2037509.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QnIOe-1wb8_zuxglKjAwOQ__original/img/LdluwRThRYmAd-1Bfu55_Wnxtps=/0x0/pic2037509.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: New York (New York, USA)", "Decades: The 1960's", "Series: Alea Big Box", "Series: Filosofia Reprints"], "categories": ["City Building", "Economic", "Negotiation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Enclosure", "Investment", "Negotiation", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement", "Trading", "Victory Points as a Resource"], "designers": ["Karsten Hartwig"], "artists": ["Mathieu Leyssenne", "Franz Vohwinkel"], "publishers": ["alea", "Ravensburger", "(Unknown)", "Competo / Marektoy", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Mandoo Games", "Quined White Goblin Games", "Siam Board Games", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u201310 in five different colors with three special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, \u00d73 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.\n\nScoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, \u00d72 for the multiplier.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "282531", "name": "Lost Cities: Etappenziele"}, {"id": "206374", "name": "Lost Cities: Expedition 6 \u2013 The Lost Expedition"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1999, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 36540, "average": 7.1756, "bayesaverage": 7.07854, "stddev": 1.26927, "median": 0.0, "owned": 50441, "trading": 869, "wanting": 479, "wishing": 3958, "numcomments": 8802, "numweights": 2895, "averageweight": 1.4974, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 321}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 69}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 337, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 256}, "2": {"best_rating": 314, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2+": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 232}}}, "usersrated": 36540.0, "average": 7.1756, "bayesaverage": 7.07854, "stddev": 1.26927, "median": 0.0, "owned": 50441.0, "trading": 869.0, "wanting": 479.0, "wishing": 3958.0, "numcomments": 8802.0, "numweights": 2895.0, "averageweight": 1.4974, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 321}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 69}], "game_family": "Lost Cities", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false}, {"id": "54", "name": "Tikal", "alternative_names": ["\u0422\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c", "\u0e15\u0e35\u0e01\u0e31\u0e25", "\u8482\u5361\u5c14\u53e4\u57ce", "\ud2f0\uce7c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ajU3xzGDUKihjNdvjCR1Hw__thumb/img/pXR57sUMEJ-GJydf-yyAu0ZLgZw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3328391.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ajU3xzGDUKihjNdvjCR1Hw__original/img/n8xE7FmOcpoH8s3bhC4Tsd1Y0PE=/0x0/pic3328391.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Guatemala", "Promotional: Promo Board Games", "Series: The Mask Trilogy (Kramer / Kiesling)", "Theme: Archaeology / Paleontology", "Theme: Tropical"], "categories": ["Exploration", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Majority / Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Grid Movement", "Hexagon Grid", "Map Addition", "Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Michael Kiesling", "Wolfgang Kramer"], "artists": ["Mariusz Gandzel", "Paul Mafayon", "Christophe Swal", "Franz Vohwinkel"], "publishers": ["Ravensburger", "Super Meeple", "Conclave Editora", "dV Giochi", "Egmont Polska", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hobby Game Mall", "Keep Exploring Games", "Kellogg's", "Maldito Games", "Rio Grande Games", "Siam Board Games", "YOKA Games", "Zvezda"], "description": "Tikal is a game of exploration within the Central American jungles in search of lost temples and the treasures within.

This player becomes the new active player for the next round.\n\nOnce a player has won a pre-determined number of Description cards, that player wins.\n\nNote: \"Party Box\" editions include all cards from Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #1 and Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #2\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "5808", "name": "Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #1"}, {"id": "5865", "name": "Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #2"}, {"id": "5801", "name": "Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #3"}, {"id": "5802", "name": "Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #4"}, {"id": "27645", "name": "Apples to Apples: Party Box Expansion ONE"}, {"id": "24303", "name": "Apples to Apples: Party Box Expansion TWO"}, {"id": "180189", "name": "Scary Apples to Apples Snack Pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1999, "minplayers": 4, "maxplayers": 10, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 17406, "average": 5.81846, "bayesaverage": 5.70755, "stddev": 1.6939, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25303, "trading": 982, "wanting": 58, "wishing": 524, "numcomments": 5081, "numweights": 1454, "averageweight": 1.1609, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4637}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 451}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 192, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 148}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 154}, "3": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 139}, "4": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 81, "not_recommended_rating": 63}, "5": {"best_rating": 52, "recommended_rating": 113, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "6": {"best_rating": 128, "recommended_rating": 51, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "7": {"best_rating": 111, "recommended_rating": 58, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "8": {"best_rating": 102, "recommended_rating": 62, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "9": {"best_rating": 41, "recommended_rating": 91, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "10": {"best_rating": 38, "recommended_rating": 84, "not_recommended_rating": 39}, "10+": {"best_rating": 22, "recommended_rating": 58, "not_recommended_rating": 64}}}, "usersrated": 17406.0, "average": 5.81846, "bayesaverage": 5.70755, "stddev": 1.6939, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25303.0, "trading": 982.0, "wanting": 58.0, "wishing": 524.0, "numcomments": 5081.0, "numweights": 1454.0, "averageweight": 1.1609, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 4637}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 451}], "game_family": "Apples to Apples", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "93", "name": "El Grande", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO282hlXR3RiknU5W4GZjg__thumb/img/3mn0EVxxfT94rit8VHiyEYztGeg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5373572.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO282hlXR3RiknU5W4GZjg__original/img/EsR_uFXj4lhQCZgbmHfNx97liPA=/0x0/pic5373572.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Country: Spain", "Game: El Grande"], "categories": ["Medieval", "Renaissance"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Turn Order: Progressive", "Turn Order: Stat-Based"], "designers": ["Wolfgang Kramer", "Richard Ulrich"], "artists": ["Doris Matth\u00e4us"], "publishers": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "999 Games", "Anv\u00e4ndbart Litet F\u00f6retag", "Descartes Editeur", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Gabinete L\u00fadico", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\n\nIn each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\n\nA turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.\n\nThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "583", "name": "The El Grande Expansions"}, {"id": "597", "name": "El Grande: Grandissimo"}, {"id": "3146", "name": "El Grande: Grossinquisitor und Kolonien"}, {"id": "370", "name": "El Grande: K\u00f6nig & Intrigant"}, {"id": "5754", "name": "El Grande: K\u00f6nig & Intrigant \u2013 Player's Edition"}, {"id": "27759", "name": "El Grande: K\u00f6nig & Intrigant \u2013 Unverk\u00e4ufliche Sonderkarten"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1995, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 23265, "average": 7.75853, "bayesaverage": 7.59546, "stddev": 1.33407, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22318, "trading": 379, "wanting": 1241, "wishing": 5163, "numcomments": 5212, "numweights": 2083, "averageweight": 3.0547, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 72}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 60}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 540, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 308}, "2": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 55, "not_recommended_rating": 345}, "3": {"best_rating": 22, "recommended_rating": 217, "not_recommended_rating": 179}, "4": {"best_rating": 174, "recommended_rating": 285, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "5": {"best_rating": 395, "recommended_rating": 94, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "5+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 212}}}, "usersrated": 23265.0, "average": 7.75853, "bayesaverage": 7.59546, "stddev": 1.33407, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22318.0, "trading": 379.0, "wanting": 1241.0, "wishing": 5163.0, "numcomments": 5212.0, "numweights": 2083.0, "averageweight": 3.0547, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 72}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 60}], "game_family": "El Grande", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "98", "name": "Axis & Allies", "alternative_names": ["Axis and Allies"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pWUe-w4DpXdcmH6GqbZqCw__thumb/img/T03oThwiFNU19-9XppxmcQ7_rMs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic24006.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pWUe-w4DpXdcmH6GqbZqCw__original/img/8S8JHFSHQQEe67A64VEAsGluB5Q=/0x0/pic24006.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Global Scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Game: Axis & Allies (Avalon Hill)", "Region: The World", "Series: Gamemaster (Milton Bradley)"], "categories": ["Economic", "Wargame", "World War II"], "implementations": ["Axis & Allies", "Axis & Allies 1941", "Axis & Allies Anniversary Edition", "Axis & Allies: 1942"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Minimap Resolution", "Stat Check Resolution", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": ["Larry Harris, Jr."], "artists": ["Jim Butcher (II)"], "publishers": ["Jedko Games", "Milton Bradley", "Nova Game Designs", "PewterCraft"], "description": "Axis and Allies is the most successful of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series.\n\nIt depicts WWII on a grand scale, full global level.

Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.\n\nThe game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.\n\nNote that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the \"Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "2949", "name": "Dune: Spice Harvest"}, {"id": "2950", "name": "Dune: The Duel"}, {"id": "264297", "name": "Dune: The Ixian Jihad"}, {"id": "197247", "name": "Dune: The Landsraad Maneuver"}, {"id": "85985", "name": "Dune: Variant Cards"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1979, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 5468, "average": 7.61904, "bayesaverage": 7.10425, "stddev": 1.68956, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6285, "trading": 188, "wanting": 614, "wishing": 2448, "numcomments": 1975, "numweights": 559, "averageweight": 3.4419, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 300}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 64}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 189}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 161, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 115}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 120}, "3": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 105}, "4": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 67, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "5": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 76, "not_recommended_rating": 31}, "6": {"best_rating": 138, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 68}}}, "usersrated": 5468.0, "average": 7.61904, "bayesaverage": 7.10425, "stddev": 1.68956, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6285.0, "trading": 188.0, "wanting": 614.0, "wishing": 2448.0, "numcomments": 1975.0, "numweights": 559.0, "averageweight": 3.4419, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 300}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 64}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 189}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "140", "name": "Pit", "alternative_names": ["Ben 10 Pit", "Billionaire", "Business", "Cambio", "Classic Pit", "Deluxe Pit", "Ding!", "Gavitt's Stock Exchange", "Get Rich Quick", "NO AGENDA: the Card Game", "Pit: The Greatest of all Party Games", "Quick 7", "Trading Pitt", "Zaster", "\u0391\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf", "\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 \u30d4\u30c3\u30c8 \u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9", "\u30d4\u30c3\u30c8", "\ud54f \ub51c\ub7ed\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LkEPNu7bPTS1rVRU_Ba-Dg__thumb/img/TTYL285XHOkpIzFtonMnuunPZS8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic423644.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LkEPNu7bPTS1rVRU_Ba-Dg__original/img/6Bk_0RHFu1863OEWAa27XBmv1-Y=/0x0/pic423644.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Mechanism: Turnless Trading", "TV Shows: The Simpsons"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Economic", "Party Game", "Real-time"], "implementations": ["Commerce"], "mechanics": ["Set Collection", "Trading"], "designers": ["Edgar Cayce", "Harry Gavitt", "George S.

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (\u201cOne! One! One!\u201d, or \u201cThree! Three! Three!\u201d) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring \u201cCorner on Wheat!\u201d or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.\n\nThe 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.\n\nPit\u2019s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt\u2019s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is     US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "60290", "name": "Pit: Tulip expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1903, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 7, "stats": {"usersrated": 8162, "average": 6.38718, "bayesaverage": 6.2136, "stddev": 1.53817, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14124, "trading": 404, "wanting": 74, "wishing": 497, "numcomments": 2506, "numweights": 562, "averageweight": 1.1601, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1641}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 155}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 532}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 80, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "4": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 44, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "5": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "6": {"best_rating": 45, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "7": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "8": {"best_rating": 52, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "8+": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 20}}}, "usersrated": 8162.0, "average": 6.38718, "bayesaverage": 6.2136, "stddev": 1.53817, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14124.0, "trading": 404.0, "wanting": 74.0, "wishing": 497.0, "numcomments": 2506.0, "numweights": 562.0, "averageweight": 1.1601, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1641}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 155}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 532}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "8", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "150", "name": "PitchCar", "alternative_names": ["Avus", "Carabande", "Carabande Audi-Edition", "Rennspiel-Action"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lvC1qJo4-RQ_zqudi_oRmA__thumb/img/7IuVc3d0QWtb0eCd6PaYHg8Qg2U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic215555.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lvC1qJo4-RQ_zqudi_oRmA__original/img/aFDFOGgN52kiEQxdoxF9KTb6NjU=/0x0/pic215555.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: PitchCar", "Mechanism: Finger Flicking Games", "Promotional: Promo Board Games", "Sports: Auto Racing"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game", "Party Game", "Racing", "Sports"], "implementations": ["PitchCar Mini"], "mechanics": ["Flicking", "Modular Board", "Race"], "designers": ["Jean du Po\u00ebl"], "artists": ["Jean du Po\u00ebl"], "publishers": ["Ferti", "Goldsieber Spiele", "Historien Spiele Galerie (Historien Spielegalerie)", "Lautapelit.fi", "Vision"], "description": "This game entry refers to two nearly identical games that are not compatible with one another.

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.\n\nThe current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178037", "name": "Beguile: PaWN The Enemy"}, {"id": "231140", "name": "Castle-Mate"}, {"id": "111363", "name": "Chess Mixer"}, {"id": "182105", "name": "CHUCK-A-CHESS"}, {"id": "251614", "name": "Code Geass: Knightmare Chess"}, {"id": "304216", "name": "Devil's Chess"}, {"id": "147313", "name": "Epic Chess"}, {"id": "191960", "name": "Fairy Tale Chess"}, {"id": "302023", "name": "Fantasy Crusaders Chess"}, {"id": "195997", "name": "Heretik Chess"}, {"id": "187247", "name": "Kingdom of Elbrandt"}, {"id": "227", "name": "Knightmare Chess"}, {"id": "155192", "name": "Knightmare Chess (Third Edition)"}, {"id": "1677", "name": "Knightmare Chess 2"}, {"id": "262716", "name": "Musketeer Chess"}, {"id": "144576", "name": "Rogue Chess"}, {"id": "67707", "name": "Royal Chess"}, {"id": "147119", "name": "Spell Chess: an Expansion to Chess"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1475, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 6, "stats": {"usersrated": 27947, "average": 7.11553, "bayesaverage": 6.93488, "stddev": 1.8353, "median": 0.0, "owned": 38705, "trading": 182, "wanting": 29, "wishing": 293, "numcomments": 6446, "numweights": 2290, "averageweight": 3.7022, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 441}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 49}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 346, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 251}, "2": {"best_rating": 327, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "2+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 277}}}, "usersrated": 27947.0, "average": 7.11553, "bayesaverage": 6.93488, "stddev": 1.8353, "median": 0.0, "owned": 38705.0, "trading": 182.0, "wanting": 29.0, "wishing": 293.0, "numcomments": 6446.0, "numweights": 2290.0, "averageweight": 3.7022, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 441}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 49}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 18, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "172", "name": "For Sale", "alternative_names": ["EladLak!", "Garage (\u06af\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062c)", "Na prodej", "Na sprzeda\u017c", "Se Vende", "Se v\u20acnde", "Vende-se", "\u0417 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430!", "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e!", "\u05e0\u05d3\u05dc\"\u05df \u05d1\u05e7\u05d8\u05df", "\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e02\u0e32\u0e22!", "\u5730\u7522\u9054\u4eba", "\u623f\u5730\u7522\u62cd\u8ce3 (\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u62cd\u5356)", "\ud22c\uc790\uc655 \ud3ec\uc138\uc77c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dJh9HkZC346NgPTAicJq_A__thumb/img/3cgW5aP-JJeKSpZMjA0NFheMnfY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1513085.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dJh9HkZC346NgPTAicJq_A__original/img/vw0xKvS_ZIxGKFVSDtvPnebUI9A=/0x0/pic1513085.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Series: Bookshelf (Gryphon Games)", "Series: Mini Games (IELLO)"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Economic"], "implementations": ["For Sale Autorama"], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Auction: Sealed Bid", "Auction: Turn Order Until Pass", "Hand Management", "Selection Order Bid"], "designers": ["Stefan Dorra"], "artists": ["\u00d3scar Aguado", "Abbas Amirabadi", "Alvin Madden", "Mahmoud Arasteh Nasab", "Mohammad Amir Garoosian", "Emilien Rotival", "Catell Ruz", "Uros Vuckovic", "Klaus Wilinski"], "publishers": ["2 Pionki", "Albi", "AURUM, Inc.", "Baborka Games", "Brain Games", "Compaya.hu - Gamer Caf\u00e9 Kft.", "Competo / Marektoy", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "F.X.

The rules are the same as the \u00dcberplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the \u00dcberplay edition).\n\nRounding rule\n\nThe rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.

But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.\n\nThe earliest mention of Go (\u00e5\u0153\u008d\u00e6\u00a3\u2039 (w\u00e9i q\u00ed)- \"surrounding game\") appears in the \"Analects\" of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17\u00d717 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).\n\nA Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as Connect6, Go-Moku, and Pente.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "253107", "name": "Joker Go"}, {"id": "219234", "name": "Poker-Go"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": -2200, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 14604, "average": 7.63959, "bayesaverage": 7.33261, "stddev": 1.9096, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20037, "trading": 266, "wanting": 148, "wishing": 1615, "numcomments": 3674, "numweights": 1413, "averageweight": 3.9993, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 165}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 13}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 213, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 135}, "2": {"best_rating": 203, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 139}}}, "usersrated": 14604.0, "average": 7.63959, "bayesaverage": 7.33261, "stddev": 1.9096, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20037.0, "trading": 266.0, "wanting": 148.0, "wishing": 1615.0, "numcomments": 3674.0, "numweights": 1413.0, "averageweight": 3.9993, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 165}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 13}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "215", "name": "Tichu", "alternative_names": ["Tai Pan", "\u0422\u0438\u0447\u0443", "\u0422\u0438\u0447\u0443", "\u5730\u4e3b", "\ud2f0\uce04"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gz8_8iYP2SSGVAxpp7CwLg__thumb/img/5jkPnPGk5LWNzuW5GANPDLa4ZRA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5854968.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gz8_8iYP2SSGVAxpp7CwLg__original/img/tK8Lf5JybOPIW69c90VW4rFt3AA=/0x0/pic5854968.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Climbing", "Card Games: Outplay", "Card Games: Shedding / Stops", "Components: Traditional Playing Cards", "Series: Deluxe card game (Z-Man / Filosofia)"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Ladder Climbing", "Team-Based Game", "Trick-taking"], "designers": ["Urs Hostettler"], "artists": ["Kerri Aitken", "Christine Alcouffe", "Res Brandenberger", "Fran\u00e7ois Bruel", "Philippe Gu\u00e9rin", "Chris Quilliams", "Valerie Vekemans", "Franz Vohwinkel"], "publishers": ["Fata Morgana Spiele", "999 Games", "ABACUSSPIELE", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "G3", "Hobby World", "HomoLudicus", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Playhouse Ltd", "Rio Grande Games", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "TIKI Editions Inc.", "uplay.it edizioni", "Venner\u00f8d Forlag AS"], "description": "Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.\n\nThe deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination \u2014 single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. \u2014 or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.\n\nThe last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses \u2014 but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call \"Tichu\" prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call \"Grand Tichu\" after looking at only their first eight cards for a \u00b1200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).\n\nThe first team to 1,000 points wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "186885", "name": "Stadt Land Spielt Limitierte Sonderdrucke 2015"}, {"id": "206088", "name": "Tichu Booster"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1991, "minplayers": 4, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 13149, "average": 7.58342, "bayesaverage": 7.33455, "stddev": 1.68714, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19936, "trading": 299, "wanting": 281, "wishing": 1765, "numcomments": 3327, "numweights": 907, "averageweight": 2.3451, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 164}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 119}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 273, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 189}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 188}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 188}, "4": {"best_rating": 254, "recommended_rating": 18, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 187}}}, "usersrated": 13149.0, "average": 7.58342, "bayesaverage": 7.33455, "stddev": 1.68714, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19936.0, "trading": 299.0, "wanting": 281.0, "wishing": 1765.0, "numcomments": 3327.0, "numweights": 907.0, "averageweight": 2.3451, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 164}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 119}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "258", "name": "Fluxx", "alternative_names": ["\u05e4\u05dc\u05d0\u05e7\u05e1", "\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9", "\u6d6e\u8a00\u6d6a\u8a9e"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZBQHRlhd32wt4F_zgeic6w__thumb/img/MjQ7iYoOXuU9AUrTojjYE8sdyTk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2405641.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZBQHRlhd32wt4F_zgeic6w__original/img/Gcf1Q_RVCGCN2FN3edPDv-ySJ1o=/0x0/pic2405641.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Fluxx", "Misc: Mensa Select"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": ["Adventure Time Fluxx", "Anatomy Fluxx", "Astronomy Fluxx", "Batman Fluxx", "Cartoon Network Fluxx", "Chemistry Fluxx", "Cthulhu Fluxx", "Doctor Who Fluxx", "Drinking Fluxx", "Fairy Tale Fluxx", "Family Fluxx", "Fantasy Fluxx", "Firefly Fluxx", "Fluxx", "Fluxx: Rick and Morty", "Fluxx: The Board Game", "Holiday Fluxx", "Jumanji Fluxx", "Martian Fluxx", "Marvel Fluxx", "Math Fluxx", "Monster Fluxx", "Monty Python Fluxx", "Nature Fluxx", "Oz Fluxx", "Pirate Fluxx", "Regular Show Fluxx", "Star Fluxx", "Star Trek Fluxx", "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Fluxx", "Star Trek: The Next Generation Fluxx", "Star Trek: Voyager Fluxx", "Stoner Fluxx", "Zombie Fluxx"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Andrew Looney", "Kristin Looney"], "artists": ["Ra\u00fal Castellanos", "Michael Hays", "Naomi Kageyama", "Andrew Looney", "Barbara Spelger"], "publishers": ["Looney Labs", "AMIGO", "Black Monk", "Edge Entertainment", "Hexagonal", "Hobby Japan", "Hobby World", "Iron Crown Enterprises", "Monkey Time", "Pegasus Spiele", "PS-Games", "Raven Distribution", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game.

"Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.\n\nWhen the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:\n\n\n     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),\n     a bonus resource,\n     an attack if a player has too many resources, and\n     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     \n\n\nThere are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.\n\nWhoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!\n\nThe Anniversary edition of this game (Jubil\u00e4umsausgabe edition) can be found under a separate game entry.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "21817", "name": "Catan Card Game: Artisans & Benefactors"}, {"id": "12543", "name": "Catan Card Game: Barbarians & Traders Upgrade

Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.\n\nSkip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow & Righter and manufactured by Cadaco. Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood. The game was also published because not enough Scrabble games were manufactured to meet the demand.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "238822", "name": "Scrabble: Big Eszett (\u00df)"}], "expands": [],

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.\n\nTo play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.\n\nIn addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!\n\n6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "20030", "name": "6 nimmt!

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\n\n From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker\u2014a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.\n\nThis is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.\n\nPlayers build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.\n\nAn important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are nearly 20,000 different cards from which to build your deck!\n\nCards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.\n\nPlayers randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called \"the stack,\" provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.\n\nThough traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "159349", "name": "Magic: The Gathering Challenge Deck \u2013 Battle the Horde"},

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.\n\nPlayers start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.\n\nOn a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.\n\nThe expansion Citadels:  The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl\u00fcck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square).

In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.\n\nIn the game, players represent one of the seven \"Great Powers of Europe\" (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of \"orders.\" The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 3\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Colonial Diplomacy\n    Diplomacy: Classical Variant\n    Diplomacy: Hundred Variant\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "54113", "name": "Diplomacy Games and Variants"}, {"id": "95273", "name": "Diplomacy: 1900 Variant"}, {"id": "9119", "name": "Diplomacy: Ard-Ri Variant"}, {"id": "9120", "name": "Diplomacy: Hundred Variant"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1959, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 360, "minplaytime": 360, "maxplaytime": 360, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 11973, "average": 7.04144, "bayesaverage": 6.78623, "stddev": 1.91289, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19993, "trading": 1074, "wanting": 164, "wishing": 1618, "numcomments": 4210, "numweights": 1115, "averageweight": 3.3561, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 592}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 241}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 449}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 276, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 203}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 202}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 19, "not_recommended_rating": 193}, "4": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 175}, "5": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 126}, "6": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 129, "not_recommended_rating": 68}, "7": {"best_rating": 254, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "7+": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 126}}}, "usersrated": 11973.0, "average": 7.04144, "bayesaverage": 6.78623, "stddev": 1.91289, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19993.0, "trading": 1074.0, "wanting": 164.0, "wishing": 1618.0, "numcomments": 4210.0, "numweights": 1115.0, "averageweight": 3.3561, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 592}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 241}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 449}], "game_family": "Diplomacy", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "7", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "3943", "name": "Munchkin 2: Unnatural Axe", "alternative_names": ["Munchkin 1+2", "Munchkin 2: Abartige Axt", "Munchkin 2: De Zwakken Geslacht", "Munchkin 2: Del\u0131 Balta", "Munchkin 2: Fajtalan fejsze", "Munchkin 2: Hacha Descomunal", "Munchkin 2: Hacha Sobrenatural", "Munchkin 2: Hachement mieux !", "Munchkin 2: L'Ascia o Raddoppia", "Munchkin 2: Machado Descomunal", "Munchkin 2: Neskute\u010dn\u00e1 sekera", "Munchkin 2: Wielosieczny top\u00f3r", "Munchkin 2: \u0391\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf \u03c4\u03c3\u03b5\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9", "Munchkin Unnatural Axe", "Munchkin: 2 L'Ascia o Raddoppia", "\u041c\u0430\u043d\u0447\u043a\u0456\u043d 2: \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u0430", "\u041c\u0430\u043d\u0447\u043a\u0438\u043d 2: \u0414\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440", "\u05de\u05e0\u05e6'\u05e7\u05d9\u05df 2: \u05d4\u05d2\u05e8\u05d6\u05df \u05d4\u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d1\u05e2\u05d9", "\u5c0f\u767d\u4e16\u7d002 \u53cd\u5e38\u65a7\u982d\u7bc7", "\uba3c\uce58\ud0a8 2: \uc5b4\uc0c9\ud55c \ub3c4\ub07c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aodU82mIunaDBUb8jC2RBQ__thumb/img/xOTsGgAcjmNdRqkOiph0sMr_9VA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2428682.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aodU82mIunaDBUb8jC2RBQ__original/img/OUPUbfz0is3hOfXzKkJDUlk0lGg=/0x0/pic2428682.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Munchkin"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Humor"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Steve Jackson (I)"], "artists": ["John Kovalic"], "publishers": ["(Unknown)", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)", "Black Monk", "BoardM Factory", "Bureau de Juegos", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Hobby World", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "NeoTroy Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "PS-Games", "Q-Workshop", "Raven Distribution", "Silver Stars Publishing", "Smart Ltd", "Steve Jackson Games", "Ubik", "Wargames Club Publishing", "\u0422\u0420\u0415\u0422\u042f \u041f\u041b\u0410\u041d\u0415\u0422\u0410"], "description": "\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPublisher's Description\n\nYou demanded it, and here it is.

If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!\" (From back of box)\n\nThe card game BANG! recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal.\n\nFour different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:\n\n     Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade\n     Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws\n     Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff\n     Renegade - Be the last person standing\n\n\n\n\nA player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff. Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.\n\nThere are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within \"range\" of your current gun.  The target player can play a \"MISSED!\" card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!\n\nInformation on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "20237", "name": "BANG!

The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.\n In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.\n Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases?

Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.\n\nThis is a rethemed version of Schotten Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.  Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an \"advanced variant\". Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.\n\nSome have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.  In the second edition of GMT's Battle Line the card quality is higher.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2000, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 15480, "average": 7.41676, "bayesaverage": 7.22199, "stddev": 1.25087, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19068, "trading": 375, "wanting": 465, "wishing": 2649, "numcomments": 4623, "numweights": 1154, "averageweight": 1.9021, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 219}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 162}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 169, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 116}, "2": {"best_rating": 161, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 104}}}, "usersrated": 15480.0, "average": 7.41676, "bayesaverage": 7.22199, "stddev": 1.25087, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19068.0, "trading": 375.0, "wanting": 465.0, "wishing": 2649.0, "numcomments": 4623.0, "numweights": 1154.0, "averageweight": 1.9021, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 219}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 162}], "game_family": "Schotten-Totten", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "811", "name": "Rummikub", "alternative_names": ["Challenge Rummy", "Classic Rummy", "Deluxe Rummikub", "Digital Game", "Disney Rummikub", "Family Rummy", "Gin Rummi Qube", "Het Huis Anubis Ris Ras +", "Kids Rummy", "Mini Rummy", "Mini-Rummy", "Miniature Rummikub", "My Rummy", "My Rummy Junior", "My Rummy Travel", "Original Rummikub", "The Original Rummikub", "Het originele Rummikub", "Pocket Rummikub", "Rack Rummy", "Reise Rummy", "Rommi", "Rum-E-Go", "Rumi K", "Rumi-K", "Rummi Clasic", "The Rummi Game", "Rummi-Q", "Rummika", "Rummikid", "Rummiking", "Rummikub 3w1", "Rummikub Classique", "Rummikub Club", "Rummikub Kompakt", "Rummikub MINI", "Rummikub Mundo: \u7d93\u5178\u7248", "Rummikub Pocket", "Rummikub With a Twist", "Rummikub XXL", "Rummikub: le rami des chiffres", "Rummy", "Rummy Champion", "Rummy De Luxe", "Rummy Joke", "Rummy Junior", "Rummy King", "Rummy mit Spielsteinen", "Rummy Squares", "Rummy-Club", "Rummy-Cue", "Rummy-Gin", "Rummy-Jack", "Rummy-O", "Rummy-O II", "Rummy-Tyle", "Rummybrix", "Rummykub Select", "Rumy", "Rumypok", "Super X-age Rummy", "Top-Rummy", "Tournament Rummikub", "\u0420\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0443\u0431", "\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1", "\u30e9\u30df\u30a3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6", "\ub8e8\ubbf8\ud050\ube0c \ud074\ub798\uc2dd"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LeaLDlTTmeN639MfuflcMw__thumb/img/CSPEyoFAcA3WwtzDekp3Mfepcek=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2286966.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LeaLDlTTmeN639MfuflcMw__original/img/4H8X72woji1Ujckz0mPbNxrftbU=/0x0/pic2286966.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Draw and Discard", "Card Games: Exchange", "Card Games: Shedding / Stops", "Components: Traditional Playing Cards", "Game: Rummikub", "Series: Senior (Cadaco)", "Series: Unser Lieblingsspiel (Georg Appl / Espenlaub)", "Traditional Card Games: Rummy"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Number"], "implementations": ["Rummikub Kids Edition", "Rummikub Twist"], "mechanics": ["Melding and Splaying", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Ephraim Hertzano"], "artists": ["(Uncredited)", "S\u0142awek Wiechowski"], "publishers": ["(Unknown)", "Alga", "Arxon", "Bello Games New York, Inc.", "Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)", "Bookmark Verlag", "Brain Games Germany", "Brio AB", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Cadaco", "Cardinal", "Carlit", "Casper", "Cayro, the games", "Clementoni", "Coneways", "Crown & Andrews Ltd.", "Dal Negro", "danspil", "Desyllas Games", "Dujardin", "Espenlaub", "Falomir Juegos", "Fame Products", "Fjar\u00f0arfell", "Fortuna Games", "Fun Connection", "Game Design", "Goliath Games", "Grow Jogos e Brinquedos", "H.

The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits.

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.\n\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: \"Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?\" or \"Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?\" Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.\n\nFirst game in the Carcassonne series.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeschreibung\n\nEine mittelalterliche Landschaft mit St\u00e4dten und Kl\u00f6stern, Stra\u00dfen und Wiesen.

Wenn dann das Pl\u00e4ttchen passend angelegt wurde, darf der Spieler entscheiden, ob auf das gerade angelegte Pl\u00e4ttchen ein Meeple als Ritter (in Stadt), Wegelagerer (auf Stra\u00dfe), M\u00f6nch (in Kloster) oder Bauer (auf Wiese) eingesetzt werden soll, vor allem wenn es vielleicht gerade der letzte ist...\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "167903", "name": "20 Jahre Darmstadt Spielt"},

Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.\n\nOver the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks. These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory.\n\nThe master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits. If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothl\u00f3rien. By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption \u2014 not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.\n\nYour journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated \u2014 and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring. To win, throw the One Ring into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.\n\nThis game should not be confused with Reiner Knizia's children's game (Lord of the Rings) with the same title, or with his very different two-player Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation.\n\nLord of the Rings - Limited Edition\n\nA special edition limited to 500 copies in the English language and 250 in German published by Sophisticated Games and Kosmos in November 2001. The Limited Edition has a silver 22 carat gold plated ring, pewter Hobbit playing pieces, and a signed and numbered John Howe print.

With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.\n\nIn more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a ton of Settlers-sized hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.\n\nFor its 20th Anniversary, Roads & Boats has an edition that contains the &cetera expansion: Roads & Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "8257", "name": "&Cetera"}, {"id": "2459", "name": "Planes & Trains"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1999, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 240, "minplaytime": 240, "maxplaytime": 240, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 3039, "average": 7.73416, "bayesaverage": 6.99542, "stddev": 1.65406, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4214, "trading": 79, "wanting": 728, "wishing": 2037, "numcomments": 1082, "numweights": 349, "averageweight": 4.1805, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 383}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 199}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 68, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "2": {"best_rating": 33, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "3": {"best_rating": 23, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 27}}}, "usersrated": 3039.0, "average": 7.73416, "bayesaverage": 6.99542, "stddev": 1.65406, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4214.0, "trading": 79.0, "wanting": 728.0, "wishing": 2037.0, "numcomments": 1082.0, "numweights": 349.0, "averageweight": 4.1805, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 383}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 199}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "891", "name": "Cranium", "alternative_names": ["Cranium Primo Edition"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-RAQw4eCx3i__6ctz6-N9A__thumb/img/6zwKtSbuLcz8negvxaM4hRA6rBw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4994220.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-RAQw4eCx3i__6ctz6-N9A__original/img/bEWXs9EG5Wtav_nU43SaUvZh4SU=/0x0/pic4994220.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Play Dough / Modeling Clay", "Game: Cranium"], "categories": ["Party Game", "Puzzle", "Trivia", "Word Game"], "implementations": ["Cranium Dice Game"], "mechanics": ["Acting", "Line Drawing", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Singing", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": ["Whit Alexander", "Richard Tait"], "artists": ["Gary Baseman"], "publishers": ["Cranium, Inc.", "danspil", "Giochi Preziosi", "Hasbro", "Jumbo"], "description": "Cranium bills itself as the \"whole-brain\" game.

"description": "Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.\n\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\n\nThe game changes the base game in three main ways:\n\nFirst, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.\n\nSecond, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)\n\nFinally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "307518", "name": "Catan Scenarios: #WeStayHome"}, {"id": "4101", "name": "Catan: Cities & Knights \u2013 5-6 Player Extension"}, {"id": "265141", "name": "Catan: Cities & Knights \u2013 Legend of the Conquerors"}, {"id": "222396", "name": "Catan: Playmat Atoll"}, {"id": "42147", "name": "Der Hafenmeister"}, {"id": "91061", "name": "Hexen, Zauberer & Drachen (fan expansion for Catan: Cities and Knights)"}, {"id": "89606", "name": "Kirche, Glaube & Reformation (fan expansion for Catan: Cities and Knights)"}, {"id": "90100", "name": "Die Pioniere (fan expansion for The Settlers of Catan)"}, {"id": "56157", "name": "Die Siedler von Catan: Sch\u00e4tze, Drachen & Entdecker"}], "expands": [{"id": "13", "name": "Catan"}], "yearpublished": 1998, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 16852, "average": 7.45974, "bayesaverage": 7.19877, "stddev": 1.45687, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33257, "trading": 431, "wanting": 224, "wishing": 1308, "numcomments": 3968, "numweights": 1325, "averageweight": 2.9004, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 166, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 126}, "2": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 113}, "3": {"best_rating": 78, "recommended_rating": 73, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4": {"best_rating": 106, "recommended_rating": 45, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4+": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 89}}}, "usersrated": 16852.0, "average": 7.45974, "bayesaverage": 7.19877, "stddev": 1.45687, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33257.0, "trading": 431.0, "wanting": 224.0, "wishing": 1308.0, "numcomments": 3968.0, "numweights": 1325.0, "averageweight": 2.9004, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "Catan", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "179275", "name": "One Deck Dungeon", "alternative_names": ["Karciane Podziemia", "Winziges Verlies", "\u8ff7\u4f60\u5730\u4e0b\u57ce"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/quvyGpE7kwbd2Mt1H5iLwQ__thumb/img/Vf5PvYElsfOG28LqJimwPC6rqw4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3019101.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/quvyGpE7kwbd2Mt1H5iLwQ__original/img/uAhlCTqgBS7ZobTYUq-yAWFwURg=/0x0/pic3019101.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Medieval", "Video Game Theme"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Melding and Splaying", "Move Through Deck", "Solo / Solitaire Game"], "designers": ["Chris Cieslik"], "artists": ["Alanna Cervenak", "Will Pitzer"], "publishers": ["Asmadi Games", "Banana Games", "Czacha Games", "Magic Store Srl", "MS Edizioni", "Nuts!

Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.\n\nDownforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.\n\nThis is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection.

Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play.

Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.\n\nThe world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.\n\nThe Euphorians aren\u2019t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand\u2014they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.\n\nThere is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they\u2019ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.\n\nIn Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.\n\nEuphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge\u2014that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.\n\nYour path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts\u2014especially matching pairs\u2014and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.\n\nFour distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "271664", "name": "Euphoria: Ignorance Is Bliss"}, {"id": "181417", "name": "Euphoria: Participate In The Game

After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans \u2014 whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.\n\nIn Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.\n\nAzul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.\n\nAt the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.\n\nAfter all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.\n\nIf you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile.\n\nAfter six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "292743", "name": "Azul: Summer Pavilion \u2013 Objective Tiles"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 5899, "average": 7.83568, "bayesaverage": 7.32018, "stddev": 1.12735, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10441, "trading": 51, "wanting": 520, "wishing": 2460, "numcomments": 894, "numweights": 140, "averageweight": 2.0357, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 172}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 16}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 74, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "2": {"best_rating": 33, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "3": {"best_rating": 38, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 36}}}, "usersrated": 5899.0, "average": 7.83568, "bayesaverage": 7.32018, "stddev": 1.12735, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10441.0, "trading": 51.0, "wanting": 520.0, "wishing": 2460.0, "numcomments": 894.0, "numweights": 140.0, "averageweight": 2.0357, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 172}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 2}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 16}], "game_family": "Azul", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "251247", "name": "Barrage", "alternative_names": ["Wasserkraft", "\u041f\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430", "\u5f3a\u56fd\u4e89\u575d", "\ubc84\ub77c\uc9c0"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jEPmWvvYpqkWrKOzqIHFsg__thumb/img/kMLIpeqA6UcUvQg2AdMwwQoEIfU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4336469.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jEPmWvvYpqkWrKOzqIHFsg__original/img/2B-1xoI7rLxznea34Hf518fQHTE=/0x0/pic4336469.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Barrage", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Economic", "Environmental", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Contracts", "End Game Bonuses", "Income", "Network and Route Building", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Turn Order: Stat-Based", "Variable Player Powers", "Variable Setup", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Tommaso Battista", "Simone Luciani"], "artists": ["Antonio De Luca"], "publishers": ["Cranio Creations", "CrowD Games", "Feuerland Spiele", "Game Harbor", "Intrafin Games", "Maldito Games", "Portal Games", "sternenschimmermeer", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)"], "description": "In the dystopic 1930s, the industrial revolution pushed the exploitation of fossil-based resources to the limit, and now the only thing powerful enough to quench the thirst for power of the massive machines and of the unstoppable engineering progress is the unlimited hydroelectric energy provided by the rivers.\n\nBarrage is a resource management strategic game in which players compete to build their majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity, and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnels connected to the energy turbines of their powerhouses.\n\nEach player represents one of the four international companies who are gathering machinery, innovative patents and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to collect and exploit the water of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers.\n\nBarrage includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms. First, the players must carefully plan their actions and handle their machinery, since both their action tokens and resources are stored on a Construction Wheel and will only be available after a full turn of the wheel. The better you manage your wheel, the earlier your resources and actions come back to you.\n\nSecond, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches the downstream dams), raise the dams to increase their capacity, and build long tunnels to channel the water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed \u2014 its flow is just used to produce energy \u2014, it is instead released back to the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players.\n\nOver five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing strategy.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "304453", "name": "Barrage: 5-Player Expansion"}, {"id": "318010", "name": "Barrage: Executive Officers

to walk the streets of Victorian London with Sherlock Holmes in search of Professor Moriarty? To search the docks for the giant rat of Sumatra? To walk up Baker Street as the fog is rolling in and hear Holmes cry out, \"Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot!\"? Now you can! You can enter the opium den beneath the Bar of Gold, but beware, that may be Colonel Sebastian Moran lurking around the corner. You can capture the mystery and excitement of Holmes' London in this challenging and informative game. You, the player, will match your deductive abilities against your opponents and the master sleuth himself, Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, you are presented with a mystery to solve, and it is then up to you to trace the threads of evidence through the byways and mansions of nineteenth century London. You will interview suspects, search the newspapers for clues, and put together the facts to reach a solution.\n\nWhy were two lions murdered in Hyde Park?

In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.\n\nHowever, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.\n\nAdditionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.\n\nPower Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

Hive is made up of twenty two pieces, eleven black and eleven white, resembling a variety of creatures each with a unique way of moving.\n\nWith no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board). Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, while at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The player to totally surround his opponent's queen wins the game.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nHive FAQ - please read before posting questions in the forum!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "244868", "name":

Will you be able to save your people in time?\n\nAtlantis Rising is a co-operative worker placement game in which you must work together with up to five other players to deploy citizens across your homeland, gathering resources in order to build a cosmic gate that can save your people. Workers placed close to the shoreline are more rewarding, but are more likely to be flooded and the actions lost.\n\nEvery turn, each player draws a misfortune card that will flood certain locations along the ever-shrinking Atlantis shoreline, or may otherwise work to undermine your efforts to save your people. So you must race to gather the necessary resources to build and power the gate, before the island disappears beneath the waves forever.\n\nThis edition contains all new art and graphic design, created to bring even more attention to the thematic setting of the game. The Athenians Attack phase has been replaced with the Wrath of the Gods phase, requiring more strategic planning and adding to the sense of urgency. Now, instead of placing workers in an Atlantean Navy, players must cooperatively decide to flood a set number of tiles at the end of each round. To further aid them in their task, Councilor player powers have been expanded and made more impactful, and the knowledge deck has similarly been revised and expanded. The variable gate components, once built, no longer offer one-time bonuses, but create new worker placement spots where players can send Atlantean workers to unleash actions to help save their island.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "295017", "name": "Atlantis Rising (Second Edition): Extended Difficulty Mini-Expansion"}, {"id": "307302", "name": "Atlantis Rising: Medusa Unleashed"}, {"id": "321302", "name": "Atlantis Rising: Monstrosities"}, {"id": "326889", "name": "Atlantis Rising: Orator"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 7, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 1416, "average": 7.88591, "bayesaverage": 6.59527, "stddev": 1.30763, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2915, "trading": 26, "wanting": 489, "wishing": 2395, "numcomments": 442, "numweights": 43, "averageweight": 2.4186, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 856}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 427}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 157}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 41, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 19, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "6": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "7": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "7+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 12}}}, "usersrated": 1416.0, "average": 7.88591, "bayesaverage": 6.59527, "stddev": 1.30763, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2915.0, "trading": 26.0, "wanting": 489.0, "wishing": 2395.0, "numcomments": 442.0, "numweights": 43.0, "averageweight": 2.4186, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 856}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 427}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 157}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false}, {"id": "156858", "name": "Black Orchestra", "alternative_names": ["Orquesta Negra"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Qsli72TNrLYOUJO8di2pYQ__thumb/img/d2ZZSGrtwz1hrkzfChFpiWGMjcc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3010368.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Qsli72TNrLYOUJO8di2pYQ__original/img/IndomJEwe-KUNwVYItC3dKM2lac=/0x0/pic3010368.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: Berlin (Germany)", "Country: Germany", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Spies/Secret Agents", "World War II"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Die Icon Resolution", "Hand Management", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Push Your Luck", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Philip duBarry"], "artists": ["Cody Jones", "Dann May", "Lucas Soriano"], "publishers": ["Game Salute", "Asmodee", "Ludonova"], "description": "As Hitler's grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination. As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators \"Schwarze Kapelle\", the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?\n\nBlack Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).\n\nBut every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.\n\nOn a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions \u2014 at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling \"Conspire\" action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.\n\nAfter the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.\n\nTo win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator & fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of \"Target\" symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any \"Eagles\" rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.\n\nPlayers will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "213777", "name": "Black Orchestra: Classified Promo Pack"}, {"id": "256249", "name": "Black Orchestra: Conspirator Pack #1"}, {"id": "256251", "name": "Black Orchestra: Conspirator Pack #2"}, {"id": "214319", "name": "Black Orchestra: Resistance Broadcast Promo"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 4075, "average": 7.51909, "bayesaverage": 6.92836, "stddev": 1.3147, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7019, "trading": 127, "wanting": 499, "wishing": 2356, "numcomments": 1003, "numweights": 117, "averageweight": 2.4103, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 456}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 98}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 75, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 38, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "2": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 37, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "5": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 28, "not_recommended_rating": 19}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 31}}}, "usersrated": 4075.0, "average": 7.51909, "bayesaverage": 6.92836, "stddev": 1.3147, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7019.0, "trading": 127.0, "wanting": 499.0, "wishing": 2356.0, "numcomments": 1003.0, "numweights": 117.0, "averageweight": 2.4103, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 456}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 98}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "41114", "name": "The Resistance", "alternative_names": ["Direni\u015f", "Mafie", "De Mol", "La R\u00e9sistance", "The Resistance: Agenci Molocha", "La Resistencia", "Rezisten\u021ba", "Der Widerstand", "\u0421\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435", "\u30ec\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30b9", "\u62b5\u6297\u7d44\u7e54", "\u62b5\u6297\u7ec4\u7ec7"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAPTkL2BR3snLO71dkH8rw__thumb/img/5lDn1W82rlLXtVG7nPIYR9Orn-4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2576459.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAPTkL2BR3snLO71dkH8rw__original/img/VDXFwn8wDc4yObdS5kUABZK6nhI=/0x0/pic2576459.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Werewolf / Mafia", "Series: Postcard Box Games (Indie Boards and Cards)", "Setting: Dystopian Universe (Indie Boards & Cards)"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction", "Negotiation", "Party Game", "Science Fiction", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "implementations": ["The Resistance: Avalon"], "mechanics": ["Hidden Roles", "Memory", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Team-Based Game", "Traitor Game", "Voting"], "designers": ["Don Eskridge"], "artists": ["Luis Francisco", "Luis Franco", "Piotr Haraszczak", "Jihoon Jang", "Maryam Khatoon", "Jordy Knoop", "Vinh Mac", "Alex Murur", "Jarek Noco\u0144", "George Patsouras", "Michael Rasmussen", "Jordan Saia", "Luis Thomas"], "publishers": ["Indie Boards & Cards", "(Web published)", "999 Games", "Devir", "Edge Entertainment", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby Japan", "HomoLudicus", "Lex Games", "Magellan", "Matagot", "MINDOK", "NeoTroy Games", "Portal Games", "Raven Distribution", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "description": "The Empire must fall.

In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!\n\nThe Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.\n\nPlayers are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players\u2019 identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win).

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.\n\nMore than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.\n\nThe overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nCopyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder, inc.\n\nPart of the Ticket to Ride series.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "197040", "name":

Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, players take on the roles of Space Marines pitted against hordes of Genestealers.\n\nPlayers choose from six different combat teams, each consisting of two Space Marines with different abilities. Each player receives three Action cards for each of his combat teams. After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers.\n\nGame play is quick and easy to learn. Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases. During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move + Activate. You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely.\n\nAction resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports. Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels.\n\nThe Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend. Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries. Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card. And then it's back into the fight!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "120965", "name": "Space Hulk: Death Angel \u2013 The Card Game \u2013 Deathwing Space Marine Pack"}, {"id": "94964", "name": "Space Hulk: Death Angel \u2013 The Card Game \u2013 Mission Pack 1"}, {"id": "94963", "name": "Space Hulk: Death Angel \u2013 The Card Game: Space Marine Pack 1"}, {"id": "115584", "name": "Space Hulk: Death Angel \u2013 The Card Game: Tyranid Enemy Pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 12080, "average": 6.99298, "bayesaverage": 6.78006, "stddev": 1.36708, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21225, "trading": 790, "wanting": 231, "wishing": 1478, "numcomments": 2999, "numweights": 764, "averageweight": 2.4149, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 603}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 177}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 298, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 185, "recommended_rating": 72, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "2": {"best_rating": 64, "recommended_rating": 133, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "3": {"best_rating": 40, "recommended_rating": 116, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "4": {"best_rating": 54, "recommended_rating": 81, "not_recommended_rating": 42}, "5": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 71, "not_recommended_rating": 71}, "6": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 65, "not_recommended_rating": 83}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 110}}}, "usersrated": 12080.0, "average": 6.99298, "bayesaverage": 6.78006, "stddev": 1.36708, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21225.0, "trading": 790.0, "wanting": 231.0, "wishing": 1478.0, "numcomments": 2999.0, "numweights": 764.0, "averageweight": 2.4149, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 603}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 177}], "game_family": "Space Hulk", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "264220", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon", "alternative_names": ["Tainted Grail: Der Niedergang Avalons", "Tainted Grail: La Chute d'Avalon", "Tainted Grail: P\u00e1d Avalonu", "Tainted Grail: Upadek Avalonu", "\u041e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0430\u043b\u044c. \u041f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0410\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0430", "\ubd80\ud328\ud55c \uc131\ubc30: \uc544\ubc1c\ub860\uc758 \ubab0\ub77d"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aAwBzPzta4joKfFZt05hCw__thumb/img/zvV21ZaydrMSEbbYSNXcmw3WmfY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4385726.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aAwBzPzta4joKfFZt05hCw__original/img/pcds4KfHd_rUfOXPNZuhZEKGHFM=/0x0/pic4385726.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Tainted Grail", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Mature / Adult", "Medieval", "Mythology", "Travel"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Cooperative Game", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Narrative Choice / Paragraph", "Push Your Luck", "Role Playing", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Krzysztof Piskorski", "Marcin \u015awierkot"], "artists": ["Piotr Foksowicz", "Ewa Labak", "Piotr Gacek"], "publishers": ["Awaken Realms", "Albi", "CrowD Games", "Edge Entertainment", "Giochi Uniti", "Maldito Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "Summon Games"], "description": "Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon  is an unforgettable, solo or cooperative adventure experience for 1-4 players. Blending Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology with a unique vision, it allows you to impact the game world in deep and meaningful ways. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike. Difficult decisions or harrowing choices wait behind every corner and seemingly minor tasks may reverberate with major long-term consequences.\n\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by con\u00ef\u00ac\u201aict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own. Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several con\u00ef\u00ac\u201aicting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to di\u00ef\u00ac\u20acerent deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\n\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need to brute force your way, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each con\u00ef\u00ac\u201aict fun and exciting, while keeping you immersed in the game.\n\nIn Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, the land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner. Many secrets can be discovered only after several games. Created by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has infusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "274797", "name": "Tainted Grail: Age of Legends"}, {"id": "297996", "name": "Tainted Grail: Forever Autumn Promo Cards"}, {"id": "308105", "name": "Tainted Grail: Past And Future Alternative Encounters Card Pack"}, {"id": "267325", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon \u2013 Echoes of the Past"}, {"id": "266659", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon \u2013 Niamh"}, {"id": "267408", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon \u2013 Red Death Expansion"}, {"id": "321718", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon \u2013 War Runes"}, {"id": "274795", "name": "Tainted Grail: The Last Knight"}, {"id": "324661", "name": "\ubd80\ud328\ud55c \uc131\ubc30: \ucd5c\ud6c4\uc758 \uae30\uc0ac\uc640 \uc804\uc124\uc758 \uc2dc\ub300"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 5140, "average": 8.46803, "bayesaverage": 7.55552, "stddev": 1.95389, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10283, "trading": 82, "wanting": 487, "wishing": 3672, "numcomments": 1548, "numweights": 245, "averageweight": 3.2776, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 85}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 16}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 284, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 153, "recommended_rating": 91, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "2": {"best_rating": 150, "recommended_rating": 87, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "3": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 106, "not_recommended_rating": 83}, "4": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 45, "not_recommended_rating": 162}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 182}}}, "usersrated": 5140.0, "average": 8.46803, "bayesaverage": 7.55552, "stddev": 1.95389, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10283.0, "trading": 82.0, "wanting": 487.0, "wishing": 3672.0, "numcomments": 1548.0, "numweights": 245.0, "averageweight": 3.2776, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 85}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 16}], "game_family": "Tainted Grail", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false}, {"id": "101721", "name": "Mage Wars Arena", "alternative_names": ["Mage Wars", "Mage Wars: Das Duell der Magier", "\u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b \u041c\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432", "\u6cd5\u5e08\u6218\u4e89"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WxajTXKxDza3UvwNMs-PUA__thumb/img/ZHMk4Aqu_VTgP9IFwY5QriZL6W8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2386027.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WxajTXKxDza3UvwNMs-PUA__original/img/vPot4QMbaHIpmKiCCJCC8VxI-9E=/0x0/pic2386027.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Binders", "Components: Polyhedral (not D6) dice", "Game: Mage Wars", "Players: Two Player Only Games"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Deck Construction", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Line of Sight", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Turn Order: Progressive", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Bryan Pope", "Benjamin Pope"], "artists": ["Drew Baker", "Tiziano Baracchi", "Claire Beard", "Leonardo Borazio", "Jason Engle", "Mariusz Gandzel", "John Guytan", "Diego Gisbert Llorens", "Raven Mimura", "Jim Pavelec", "Roberto Pitturru", "R.

How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?\n\nMage Wars \u2014 redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy \u2014 pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts \u2013 all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!\n\nMage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called \"zones\", which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.\n\nEach player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells \u2013 such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments \u2013 are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.\n\nEvery Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:\n\n\n    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.\n    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.\n    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.\n    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.\n\n\nThe base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.\n\nNew Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game. The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!\n\nExtra copies of spells available with:\n\n    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1\n    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions":

The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.\n\nPlayers build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities.  Each route must consist of at least three cities.  Players may only build one route at a time.  Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.\n\nPlayers start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card.  The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards.  On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one.  If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it.  The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage.  Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route.  Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn.\n\nWhen a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered.  Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends.  Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, and lose points for unplaced post offices.

Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "280833", "name": "Through the Ages: New Leaders and Wonders"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 22233, "average": 8.43582, "bayesaverage": 8.19648, "stddev": 1.50761, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25967, "trading": 337, "wanting": 1050, "wishing": 7638, "numcomments": 3310, "numweights": 1109, "averageweight": 4.4121, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 6}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 6}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 530, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 305}, "2": {"best_rating": 130, "recommended_rating": 314, "not_recommended_rating": 35}, "3": {"best_rating": 346, "recommended_rating": 121, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4": {"best_rating": 83, "recommended_rating": 225, "not_recommended_rating": 134}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 274}}}, "usersrated": 22233.0, "average": 8.43582, "bayesaverage": 8.19648, "stddev": 1.50761, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25967.0, "trading": 337.0, "wanting": 1050.0, "wishing": 7638.0, "numcomments": 3310.0, "numweights": 1109.0, "averageweight": 4.4121, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 6}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 6}], "game_family": "Through the Ages", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "182134", "name": "Evolution: Climate", "alternative_names": ["Evolution: Climat", "\u042d\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f. \u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442", "\uc5d0\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158: \uae30\ud6c4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hs1P4qPgDKHXct3qs4JWGg__thumb/img/WUTqvVmA5QUW5KJ9wVF4FdnziI0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2876816.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hs1P4qPgDKHXct3qs4JWGg__original/img/MjKqZW58ldj6gdgQFAqPqERNNec=/0x0/pic2876816.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Series: Evolution (North Star Games)", "Theme: Biology", "Theme: Evolution", "Theme: Nature"], "categories": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Educational", "Environmental", "Fighting", "Prehistoric", "Print & Play"], "implementations": ["Evolution"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Events", "Hand Management", "Push Your Luck", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation", "Take That", "Turn Order: Progressive"], "designers": ["Dominic Crapuchettes", "Dmitry Knorre", "Sergey Machin"], "artists": ["Ben Goldman", "Catherine Hamilton", "Jacoby O'Connor"], "publishers": ["North Star Games", "(Web published)", "Funforge", "Mandoo Games", "Rightgames RBG SIA"], "description": "Evolution: Climate is a standalone game that introduces climate into the Evolution game system.\n\nIn Evolution: Climate, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce, predators lurk, and the climate can swing between scorching hot and icy cold.

But not every employee is up to every task, so you must choose and lead your employees wisely \u2014 especially since each employee grants a unique bonus and some of these bonuses generate prestige points.\n\nAfter seven rounds, the game ends with the big ball and a final scoring.

In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.\n\nThe development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.\n\nThere are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?\n\n\nGame Summary\nEach player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:\n- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.\n- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.\n- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.\n\nThe central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:\n- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces\n- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.\n- earn 2 coins\n- take 2 temporary workers\n- jump ahead in turn order\n- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you\n\nEach round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.\n\nAfter 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "206944", "name": "Russian Railroads: American Railroads"}, {"id": "181693", "name": "Russian Railroads: German Railroads"}, {"id": "234335", "name": "Russian Railroads: Juri Dreigleisky"}, {"id": "325037", "name": "Russian Railroads: Manufactory Train"}, {"id": "166410", "name": "Russian Railroads: Mini-Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 14489, "average": 7.77424, "bayesaverage": 7.54685, "stddev": 1.28302, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14628, "trading": 133, "wanting": 1073, "wishing": 3880, "numcomments": 2252, "numweights": 744, "averageweight": 3.4113, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 87}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 66}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 202, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 89}, "2": {"best_rating": 39, "recommended_rating": 121, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "3": {"best_rating": 66, "recommended_rating": 96, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4": {"best_rating": 127, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 89}}}, "usersrated": 14489.0, "average": 7.77424, "bayesaverage": 7.54685, "stddev": 1.28302, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14628.0, "trading": 133.0, "wanting": 1073.0, "wishing": 3880.0, "numcomments": 2252.0, "numweights": 744.0, "averageweight": 3.4113, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 87}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 66}], "game_family": "Russian Railroads", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "229853", "name": "Teotihuacan: City of Gods", "alternative_names": ["Teotihuacan: Citt\u00e0 degli Dei", "Teotihuacan: Ciudad de Dioses", "Teotihuacan: Die Stadt der G\u00f6tter", "Teotihuacan: La Cit\u00e9 Des Dieux", "Teotihuacan: Miasto Bog\u00f3w", "Teotihuacan: Stad der Goden", "\u0422\u0435\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0443\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d. \u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432", "\u30c6\u30aa\u30c6\u30a3\u30ef\u30ab\u30f3\uff1a\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30aa\u30d6\u30b4\u30c3\u30ba", "\ud14c\uc624\ud2f0\uc6b0\uc544\uce78: \uc2e0\ub4e4\uc758 \ub3c4\uc2dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wW5xjgBJcFyLaEWZwrYuKA__thumb/img/MppmP7GtDAfKiB5LiAl-ZtPxOPE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4583626.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wW5xjgBJcFyLaEWZwrYuKA__original/img/gzpgd8o15PVOgMhmcd57QijX57Q=/0x0/pic4583626.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Mexico", "Game: Teotihuacan", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Native Americans / First Peoples"], "categories": ["Ancient"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Rondel", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tile Placement", "Track Movement", "Variable Setup", "Worker Placement", "Worker Placement with Dice Workers"], "designers": ["Daniele Tascini"], "artists": ["Odysseas Stamoglou"], "publishers": ["NSKN Games", "Board&Dice", "Bucaneiros Jogos", "CrowD Games", "Game Harbor", "Giochix.it", "Jumping Turtle Games", "Maldito Games", "Pixie Games", "Portal Games", "Schwerkraft-Verlag", "sternenschimmermeer", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)"], "description": "Travel back in time to the greatest city in Mesoamerica.

It\u2019s not one, but two, complete expansions: the sprawling dungeon of Undermountain and the criminal haven of Skullport.\n\nEach thrilling location has unique characteristics and offers new play options, including new Lords, Buildings, Intrigue, and Quest cards.\n\nOwners of Lords of Waterdeep can use one or both of these new subterranean locations to add depth to their game experience. There\u2019s also a new faction, the Gray Hands, so now a sixth player can join in the fun!\n\nThe Undermountain Module\n\nUndermountain is a vast and multileveled dungeon beneath Mount Waterdeep that once served the crazed wizard Halaster as a site for magical experiments. Now it is a labyrinthine maze with few refuges for weary adventurers.\n\nThe rumored wealth of Undermountain entices adventurers to brave the mysteries and monsters beneath the City of Splendors. The risks and the rewards are greater for undertaking Quests that require more Gold and Adventurers.\n\nThe Skullport Module\n\nSkullport\u2014also known as the Port of Shadow\u2014is nestled in the heart of Undermountain, deep below the streets of Waterdeep. It is a haven for nefarious crimes, underhanded deals, and back-alley murders. Those who visit Skullport do so at their own peril, for around every corner are new ways to make people disappear.\n\nThe Skullport module includes a new resource: Corruption. Unlike Adventurers and Gold, having Corruption in your tavern penalizes you at the end of the game.\n\nEach Corruption token in your Tavern at the end of the game is worth negative Victory Points. The exact negative value depends on how much Corruption has been collected throughout the game; the more corrupt you and your fellow Lords are, the more Corruption hurts your score.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [{"id": "110327", "name": "Lords of Waterdeep"}], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 11233, "average": 8.21997, "bayesaverage": 7.85866, "stddev": 1.07926, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25920, "trading": 184, "wanting": 502, "wishing": 1919, "numcomments": 2167, "numweights": 360, "averageweight": 2.6556, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 106, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 73}, "2": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "3": {"best_rating": 43, "recommended_rating": 46, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 71, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 38, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "6": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 46, "not_recommended_rating": 30}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 60}}}, "usersrated": 11233.0, "average": 8.21997, "bayesaverage": 7.85866, "stddev": 1.07926, "median": 0.0, "owned": 25920.0, "trading": 184.0, "wanting": 502.0, "wishing": 1919.0, "numcomments": 2167.0, "numweights": 360.0, "averageweight": 2.6556, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "Lords of Waterdeep", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "91312", "name": "Discworld: Ankh-Morpork", "alternative_names": ["Ankh-Morpork", "Discworld: \u0391\u03bd\u03ba \u039c\u03cc\u03c1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03ba", "Disque-Monde: Ankh-Morpork", "Mundodisco: Ankh-Morpork", "Scheibenwelt: Ankh-Morpork", "\u015awiat Dysku: Ankh-Morpork", "Terry Pratchett's Ankh-Morpork", "Zem\u011bplocha: Ankh-Morpork", "\u041f\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043d\u043a-\u041c\u043e\u0440\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043a"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPDDEVveK_Pfrd79cEakRg__thumb/img/eVEBMG0eGKr-E0SSPd5TNkvQRkY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1062739.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPDDEVveK_Pfrd79cEakRg__original/img/DtOjxhp7fl74q7PCE4IVtqp2gqc=/0x0/pic1062739.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Books: Discworld", "Series: Literature (Kosmos)"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "City Building", "Deduction", "Fantasy", "Novel-based"], "implementations": ["Nanty Narking"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Events", "Hand Management", "Hidden Roles", "Interrupts", "Roles with Asymmetric Information", "Take That"], "designers": ["Martin Wallace"], "artists": ["Peter Dennis", "Paul Kidby", "Ian Mitchell", "Bernard Pearson"], "publishers": ["Treefrog Games", "Devir", "Esdevium", "IELLO", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "KOSMOS", "Mayfair Games", "Phalanx Games Polska", "REXhry", "Zvezda"], "description": "Martin Wallace and Treefrog Games present Ankh-Morpork, set in the largest city-state in Terry Pratchett's Discworld.

Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they\u2019ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player\u2019s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.\n\nDuring the game, you have two goals:\n\n    Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.\n    Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "231506", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017"}, {"id": "308918", "name": "Clank!

Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk \u2014 and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...\n\nIn Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.\n\nEach round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.\n\nHeroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat and by gryphon to get to everywhere they need to go to satisfy their quests \u2014 or to position themselves for what night brings. As each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.\n\nDuring the night, players must face the challenge of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.\n\nThe game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner!\n\n\nFor a deluxe edition of this game, see Tiny Epic Quest: Deluxe Edition\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "225982", "name": "Tiny Epic Quest: Quest for the Golden Mushrooms"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 5894, "average": 7.07842, "bayesaverage": 6.70234, "stddev": 1.32553, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15786, "trading": 379, "wanting": 200, "wishing": 1625, "numcomments": 1391, "numweights": 110, "averageweight": 2.6727, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 706}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 462}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 80, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 40, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "2": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "3": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 28, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 30}}}, "usersrated": 5894.0, "average": 7.07842, "bayesaverage": 6.70234, "stddev": 1.32553, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15786.0, "trading": 379.0, "wanting": 200.0, "wishing": 1625.0, "numcomments": 1391.0, "numweights": 110.0, "averageweight": 2.6727, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 706}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 462}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "70919", "name": "Takenoko", "alternative_names": ["\u0422\u0430\u043a\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a\u043e", "\u05d8\u05e7\u05e0\u05d5\u05e7\u05d5", "\u30bf\u30b1\u30ce\u30b3", "\u5fa1\u7af9\u5712"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uvz-5V6A2R6dp2oWIXmj_g__thumb/img/vz9Ec1xB2b4JJQlZFijUsuCvfkQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1912529.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uvz-5V6A2R6dp2oWIXmj_g__original/img/7SDbClO-4sN6LICvfySB3jrFUhU=/0x0/pic1912529.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Pandas", "Country: Japan", "Theme: Gardening", "Theme: Nature", "Theme: Trees and Forests"], "categories": ["Animals", "Environmental", "Farming", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Network and Route Building", "Pattern Building", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Antoine Bauza"], "artists": ["Nicolas Fructus", "Picksel", "Yuio"], "publishers": ["Bombyx", "Matagot", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "FoxMind Israel", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hobby Japan", "Hobby World", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Lex Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "REXhry", "Surfin' Meeple", "Surfin' Meeple China"], "description": "A long time ago at the Japanese Imperial court, the Chinese Emperor offered a giant panda bear as a symbol of peace to the Japanese Emperor.

As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!\n\nTo impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:\n\n\n     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies.

You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.\n\n\n\n     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement \u2014 whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress \u2014 you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.\n\n\nThe game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "265125", "name": "Garphill Games 5-Year Anniversary Promo Pack"}, {"id": "190798", "name": "The North Sea Runesaga"}, {"id": "247806", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: Ceedee Promo Card"}, {"id": "210164", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: Fields of Fame"}, {"id": "274240", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: Garphill Games 5-Year Anniversary Promo Cards"}, {"id": "210163", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: Hall of Heroes"}, {"id": "253275", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: Jarl Promo"}, {"id": "248494", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: Outsiders"}, {"id": "234362", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: Rod & Pep Watch It Played Promo"}, {"id": "249301", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: Solo Variant"}, {"id": "247805", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: The Meeple Men Promo Card"}, {"id": "236824", "name": "Raiders of the North Sea: The Mico Promo"}, {"id": "301401", "name": "Rovers van de Noordzee: Helden uit het Noorden"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 80, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 80, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 15165, "average": 7.78907, "bayesaverage": 7.53897, "stddev": 1.18128, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20010, "trading": 165, "wanting": 1008, "wishing": 5223, "numcomments": 2324, "numweights": 455, "averageweight": 2.5253, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 88}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 78}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 231, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 101}, "2": {"best_rating": 40, "recommended_rating": 122, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "3": {"best_rating": 137, "recommended_rating": 55, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 59, "recommended_rating": 104, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 108}}}, "usersrated": 15165.0, "average": 7.78907, "bayesaverage": 7.53897, "stddev": 1.18128, "median": 0.0, "owned": 20010.0, "trading": 165.0, "wanting": 1008.0, "wishing": 5223.0, "numcomments": 2324.0, "numweights": 455.0, "averageweight": 2.5253, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 88}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 78}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 13, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "170216", "name": "Blood Rage", "alternative_names": ["\u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0438 \u042f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c", "\u041a\u0440\u044a\u0432 \u0438 \u042f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442", "\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8", "\u8840\u8272\u72c2\u6012", "\ube14\ub7ec\ub4dc \ub808\uc774\uc9c0"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__thumb/img/NLhVdU8xazrgS5dA6nVCYmN2DNI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2439223.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__original/img/p4IovYzLVXqxY40lbGUu92VxaIQ=/0x0/pic2439223.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Control Boards", "Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Blood Rage", "Mythology: Norse", "Theme: Vikings"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Mythology"], "implementations": ["Midgard"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "designers": ["Eric M.

Ragnar\u00f6k has come, and it\u2019s the end of the world! It\u2019s the Vikings\u2019 last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin\u2019s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar\u00f6k, the ultimate inescapable doom.\n\nMost player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \u201cGods\u2019 Gifts\u201d grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.\n\nPlayers must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents\u2019 strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent\u2019s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "174506", "name": "Blood Rage: 5th Player Expansion"}, {"id": "311901", "name": "Blood Rage: Fenrir"}, {"id": "174801", "name": "Blood Rage: Gods of \u00c1sgard"}, {"id": "193898", "name": "Blood Rage: Hili \u2013 The Even-Handed"}, {"id": "174388", "name": "Blood Rage: Kickstarter Exclusives"}, {"id": "310026", "name": "Blood Rage: Mystic Troll"}, {"id": "175100", "name": "Blood Rage: Mystics of Midgard"}, {"id": "286883", "name": "Blood Rage: Promos Box"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 32906, "average": 7.99805, "bayesaverage": 7.81964, "stddev": 1.40647, "median": 0.0, "owned": 39307, "trading": 325, "wanting": 1504, "wishing": 9971, "numcomments": 4999, "numweights": 1086, "averageweight": 2.8794, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 35}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 30}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 649, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 388}, "2": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 159, "not_recommended_rating": 322}, "3": {"best_rating": 93, "recommended_rating": 417, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "4": {"best_rating": 509, "recommended_rating": 79, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4+": {"best_rating": 83, "recommended_rating": 145, "not_recommended_rating": 129}}}, "usersrated": 32906.0, "average": 7.99805, "bayesaverage": 7.81964, "stddev": 1.40647, "median": 0.0, "owned": 39307.0, "trading": 325.0, "wanting": 1504.0, "wishing": 9971.0, "numcomments": 4999.0, "numweights": 1086.0, "averageweight": 2.8794, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 35}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 30}], "game_family": "Blood Rage", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "170416", "name": "Vast: The Crystal Caverns", "alternative_names": ["Trove: The Crystal Caverns", "Vast: As Cavernas de Cristal", "Vast: Die Kristallh\u00f6hlen", "Vast: Las Cavernas Cristalinas", "Vast: Le Caverne di Cristallo"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CeXtELC0X1xjwuend_7pTg__thumb/img/FdE8SHtb503f9ZOk_TYyxS-sJQg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2962290.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CeXtELC0X1xjwuend_7pTg__original/img/i52oRYMg5KHPNJ0bhFEHycEhUyM=/0x0/pic2962290.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Vast", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Print & Play"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Role Playing", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Patrick Leder", "David Somerville"], "artists": ["Kyle Ferrin"], "publishers": ["Leder Games", "2Tomatoes Games", "Mandala Jogos", "MS Edizioni", "Quality Beast"], "description": "The dragon has been asleep for many long years.

management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.\n\nEach turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.\n\nAfter the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.\n\nThe game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.\n\nThe 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2004, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 10889, "average": 7.58494, "bayesaverage": 7.31773, "stddev": 1.28984, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10805, "trading": 275, "wanting": 813, "wishing": 2644, "numcomments": 3011, "numweights": 1129, "averageweight": 3.3764, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 175}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 115}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 277, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 135}, "2": {"best_rating": 61, "recommended_rating": 115, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "3": {"best_rating": 64, "recommended_rating": 159, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4": {"best_rating": 185, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 113}}}, "usersrated": 10889.0, "average": 7.58494, "bayesaverage": 7.31773, "stddev": 1.28984, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10805.0, "trading": 275.0, "wanting": 813.0, "wishing": 2644.0, "numcomments": 3011.0, "numweights": 1129.0, "averageweight": 3.3764, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 175}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 115}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "9220", "name": "Saboteur", "alternative_names": ["Arany\u00e1s\u00f3k", "Sabota\u017cysta", "Sabot\u00e9r", "\u03a3\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1", "\u0413\u043d\u043e\u043c\u044b-\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438", "\u0421\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440", "\u05e1\u05d1\u05d0\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8", "\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0631\u0628", "\u304a\u90aa\u9b54\u8005", "\u77ee\u4eba\u6398\u91d1", "\uc0ac\ubcf4\ud0c0\uc9c0"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0vJwP6NGa7GHPZKC3gplUw__thumb/img/B3j-is62fP09eHP34uFG_gsxNQs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3989824.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0vJwP6NGa7GHPZKC3gplUw__original/img/jhL_ucB9VxMroXQc5Zx0oGstH2U=/0x0/pic3989824.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Saboteur", "Theme: Mining"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Party Game"], "implementations": ["Saboteur: The Lost Mines"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Hidden Roles", "Map Addition", "Network and Route Building", "Take That", "Team-Based Game", "Traitor Game"], "designers": ["Fr\u00e9deric Moyersoen"], "artists": ["Andrea Boekhoff", "Fr\u00e9deric Moyersoen"], "publishers": ["AMIGO", "999 Games", "Albi", "Asmodee", "Boardgame Space", "Br\u00e4dspel.se", "Brain Games", "Bureau de Juegos", "Corfix", "Dal Negro", "Dr. Wood Challenge Centre", "Fractal Juegos", "G3", "Gigamic", "Giochi Uniti", "HaKubia", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Kikigagne?", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Mayfair Games", "Meeples Cafe", "Mercurio", "M\u00f6bius Games", "PaperGames (III)", "Paradigm Infinitum Pte Ltd", "Piatnik", "Sun Team Day Hobby Company", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "VR Distribution", "Z-Man Games, Inc.", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433", "\u0412\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438"], "description": "Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\n\nWith the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.\n\nThe Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.\n\nPlayers have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.\n\nThe Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.\n\nThe miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.\n\nAction Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.\n\nOnce a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over.

The soldier, on the other hand...\n\nNemesis is a semi-cooperative game in which you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms. To win the game, you have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece. You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI), the poor physical condition of the ship, agendas held by your fellow players, and sometimes just cruel fate.\n\nThe gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climactic moments which, hopefully, you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "295927", "name": "Nemesis: Achievement Cards"}, {"id": "244912", "name": "Nemesis: Adrestia"}, {"id": "318351", "name": "Nemesis: Aftermath"}, {"id": "256377", "name": "Nemesis: Aftermath & Void Seeders"}, {"id": "312736", "name": "Nemesis: Aftermath & Void Seeders & Medic"}, {"id": "297911", "name": "Nemesis: Blood Tests Deck"}, {"id": "245845", "name": "Nemesis: Carnomorphs"}, {"id": "274532", "name": "Nemesis: Dice Tower 2019 Promo Cards"}, {"id": "321742", "name": "Nemesis: Lockdown \u2013 Stretch Goals"}, {"id": "297660", "name": "Nemesis: Man V Meeple Season 3 Feat Promo Cards"}, {"id": "245846", "name": "Nemesis: Medic Character Expansion"}, {"id": "275277", "name": "Nemesis: Untold Stories #1"}, {"id": "310118", "name": "Nemesis: Untold Stories #2"}, {"id": "313790", "name": "Nemesis: Void Seeders"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 11041, "average": 8.41064, "bayesaverage": 7.8751, "stddev": 1.55191, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15774, "trading": 43, "wanting": 957, "wishing": 6679, "numcomments": 2194, "numweights": 424, "averageweight": 3.3491, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 26}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 10}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 249, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 99, "not_recommended_rating": 68}, "2": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 105, "not_recommended_rating": 49}, "3": {"best_rating": 56, "recommended_rating": 124, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4": {"best_rating": 154, "recommended_rating": 52, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "5": {"best_rating": 87, "recommended_rating": 72, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "5+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 113}}}, "usersrated": 11041.0, "average": 8.41064, "bayesaverage": 7.8751, "stddev": 1.55191, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15774.0, "trading": 43.0, "wanting": 957.0, "wishing": 6679.0, "numcomments": 2194.0, "numweights": 424.0, "averageweight": 3.3491, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 26}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 10}], "game_family": "Nemesis", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "19777", "name": "Indonesia", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__thumb/img/RCh0FVF5BT9-ATms0Wc_6hs2z5I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic93485.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__original/img/GoIqNsMgEj-JhrtNwUtsuv6P3AM=/0x0/pic93485.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Indonesia"], "categories": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Transportation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Stock Holding"], "designers": ["Jeroen Doumen", "Joris Wiersinga"], "artists": ["Jeroen Kesselaar", "Ynze Moedt"], "publishers": ["Splotter Spellen"], "description": "Judging by the smirk on the face of the Sultan of Solo, the businessman from North Sumatra has just made a mistake. And a costly one at that, too.

That might change the outlook \u2026 considerably, in fact \u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026\n\nIndonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.\n\nPlayers keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2005, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 240, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 240, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 3978, "average": 7.85328, "bayesaverage": 7.21579, "stddev": 1.53675, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4718, "trading": 59, "wanting": 822, "wishing": 2206, "numcomments": 1241, "numweights": 410, "averageweight": 3.9902, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 224}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 118}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 127, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 64}, "2": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 63}, "3": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 64, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "4": {"best_rating": 95, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 60, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 51}}}, "usersrated": 3978.0, "average": 7.85328, "bayesaverage": 7.21579, "stddev": 1.53675, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4718.0, "trading": 59.0, "wanting": 822.0, "wishing": 2206.0, "numcomments": 1241.0, "numweights": 410.0, "averageweight": 3.9902, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 224}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 118}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "19857", "name": "Glory to Rome", "alternative_names": ["Dics\u0151s\u00e9g R\u00f3m\u00e1nak!", "La Gloire de Rome", "Gloria a Roma", "Na chwa\u0142\u0119 Rzymu", "Ruhm f\u00fcr Rom", "Sit Gloria Romae", "\u7f85\u99ac\u69ae\u5149", "\u7f85\u99ac\u69ae\u8000"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S_-n-WRvpzgH-d8xuzJgmg__thumb/img/2KvAr_TOIvW-9DNxlX-KuyL0Fwo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1079512.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S_-n-WRvpzgH-d8xuzJgmg__original/img/iQCHNzUcG_az-DZ4khEz0vAa2qs=/0x0/pic1079512.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Ancient: Rome", "Cities: Rome (Lazio, Italy)", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Mechanism: Tableau Building"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "City Building", "Economic"], "implementations": ["Mottainai", "Uchronia"], "mechanics": ["End Game Bonuses", "Follow", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Variable Phase Order"], "designers": ["Ed Carter", "Carl Chudyk"], "artists": ["Ed Carter", "Valerio Cioni", "Klemens Franz", "Felix Girke", "Heiko G\u00fcnther", "Igor Wolski"], "publishers": ["Cambridge Games Factory", "Boat City", "Compaya.hu - Gamer Caf\u00e9 Kft.", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "HomoLudicus", "Lookout Games", "uplay.it edizioni"], "description": "In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.\n\nGlory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.\n\nThe lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.

This narrative game for one to six players allows players to build their own unique hero and embark on six noble quests. Battle goblins, foil the plot of an evil lord, and add a new story to your tale!\n\nPrepare for Adventure\nLegacy of Dragonholt is a narrative adventure game that creates a unique experience by blending aspects of roleplaying and adventure games, open world concept video games, and even Choose Your Own Adventure books. Unlike many games, Legacy of Dragonholt is not about winning or losing, but rather about the act of creating a story. Without the need for a Game Master, this game ensures that every player has the opportunity to shape how their adventure plays out while its intuitive gameplay means that you waste little time before jumping into your tale.\n\nBefore you first set out on your adventure, you must confront one of the most difficult questions in gaming: who will you become? Legacy of Dragonholt gives you the opportunity to play as one of six humanoid races that reside in Terrinoth: humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, gnomes, and catfolk. Next, you'll select a class, before defining your physical and personality traits, and scribing a personal history. Each of these features creates a multifaceted character and defines the types of traits you possess, which in turn affect how you will approach obstacles throughout your journey and how you'll contribute to your party. For an in-depth look at the character creation process, you may look at our previous article here. Once you've created your own unique character, you're ready to dive in to a narrative adventure unlike any you\u2019ve seen before.\n\nExplore The Realm\nOnce your journey begins, Legacy of Dragonholt combines two forms of gameplay between the comprehensive Village Book and the six quest books that provide the plotlines of your tales. Within Dragonholt Village, you will encounter many colorful characters, each with their own stories that progress and interweave regardless of your involvement. The world is yours to explore, but it is not yours to control. Like a real community, the places you can explore vary depending on when you visit, and your encounters with the locals change depending on your traits and past experiences. For instance, a bakery may only be open early in the day, and the baker themselves may take a shine to you if you\u2019ve already met their cousin, or if they\u2019ve heard of the great deeds you\u2019ve accomplished earlier in your stay in the village. Outside the relative safety of the village, thrilling dangers and mysteries await that you can experience in six unique quests. You will investigate strange happenings within in the village and venture into the wilds beyond to journey through deep woods, delve into dark crypts, and confront creatures long thought dead. As you progress throughout the game you will find that, like your village experience, your quests also change based on your past experience, who you have or have not met, and how much time has passed. After all, if you learn that someone is in peril to the west of Dragonholt Village, they are not likely to wait patiently for three days while you explore in the east. Your actions have consequences, but ultimately the choice lies with you. You do not have to be a hero. This is your story, and it is yours to define.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 999, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 999, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 2149, "average": 7.2946, "bayesaverage": 6.51703, "stddev": 1.7299, "median": 0.0, "owned": 5112, "trading": 163, "wanting": 370, "wishing": 2032, "numcomments": 544, "numweights": 74, "averageweight": 1.2027, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 985}, {"id": "16", "name": "rpgitem", "friendlyname": "RPG Item Rank", "value": 434}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 180}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 98, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 72, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2": {"best_rating": 19, "recommended_rating": 46, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "3": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 31, "not_recommended_rating": 25}, "4": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 41}, "5": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 9, "not_recommended_rating": 51}, "6": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 54}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 56}}}, "usersrated": 2149.0, "average": 7.2946, "bayesaverage": 6.51703, "stddev": 1.7299, "median": 0.0, "owned": 5112.0, "trading": 163.0, "wanting": 370.0, "wishing": 2032.0, "numcomments": 544.0, "numweights": 74.0, "averageweight": 1.2027, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 985}, {"id": "16", "name": "rpgitem", "friendlyname": "RPG Item Rank", "value": 434}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 180}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "216132", "name": "Clans of Caledonia", "alternative_names": ["Clan di Caledonia", "Clanes de Caledonia", "Cl\u00e3s da Caled\u00f4nia", "Klany Kaledonii", "\u041a\u043b\u0430\u043d\u044b \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0438", "\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30ab\u30ec\u30c9\u30cb\u30a2", "\ud074\ub79c \uc624\ube0c \uce7c\ub808\ub3c4\ub2c8\uc544"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SPuwc6RJ6y4PnTH36Pegsg__thumb/img/M_6Yxp0A_NbebWk3Mepinsm96WI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3511783.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SPuwc6RJ6y4PnTH36Pegsg__original/img/wMBrwd-ZnHVV_XvVT3Tc6LtD0Ng=/0x0/pic3511783.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Cattle / Cows", "Animals: Sheep", "Country: Scotland", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Crowdfunding: zagramwto", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Economic", "Farming"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Commodity Speculation", "Contracts", "Dice Rolling", "Market", "Modular Board", "Network and Route Building", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Turn Order: Pass Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Juma Al-JouJou"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz"], "publishers": ["Karma Games", "BoardM Factory", "CrowD Games", "Czacha Games", "Gen-X Games", "MeepleBR", "Pixie Games", "Red Glove", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)"], "description": "Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland.

When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play solo or with friends throughout your campaign. It's easy to swap players in and out at will. Your goal is to find at least fourteen totems hidden throughout the world. Like reading a book, you'll complete this journey one or two hours at a time, discovering new lands, stories, and challenges along the way.\n\nSleeping Gods is an atlas game. Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward.\n\nSleeping Gods is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters. Your choices affect the characters and the plot of the game, and may help or hinder your chances of getting home!\n\nWelcome to a vast world. Your journey starts now.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "287670", "name": "Sleeping Gods: Dungeons"}, {"id": "309222", "name": "Sleeping Gods: Saxophone Promo Card"}, {"id": "283766", "name": "Sleeping Gods: Tides of Ruin"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2020, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 840, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 840, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 60, "average": 8.63667, "bayesaverage": 5.59635, "stddev": 1.38807, "median": 0.0, "owned": 405, "trading": 3, "wanting": 339, "wishing": 3002, "numcomments": 309, "numweights": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 7173}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 865}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 2, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}}}, "usersrated": 60.0, "average": 8.63667, "bayesaverage": 5.59635, "stddev": 1.38807, "median": 0.0, "owned": 405.0, "trading": 3.0, "wanting": 339.0, "wishing": 3002.0, "numcomments": 309.0, "numweights": 2.0, "averageweight": 2.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 7173}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 865}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "97207", "name": "Dungeon Petz", "alternative_names": ["P\u0159\u00ed\u0161erky z Podzem\u00ed", "Pupile Podziemi", "\u041f\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0446\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0439", "\u5730\u57ce\u5bf5\u7269"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7JjAm9RM8E2pbu5KCCbsTQ__thumb/img/vySdmxWBad2T5Xrylxv-jYukFmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1103979.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7JjAm9RM8E2pbu5KCCbsTQ__original/img/ouBrnOPtxRPIo3qJm2WqQjKt3Ag=/0x0/pic1103979.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Creatures: Monsters", "Game: Dungeon Lords"], "categories": ["Animals", "Fantasy", "Humor"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Vlaada Chv\u00e1til"], "artists": ["David Cochard"], "publishers": ["Czech Games Edition", "GaGa Games", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "HomoLudicus", "IELLO", "MINDOK", "One Moment Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business \u2013 breeding and selling petz.

And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn't take the action first!?\n\nDecks are small, and randomness in the game is heavily mitigated by the wealth of tactical decisions offered on the game board.

They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the \u2018Imascheren\u2019 (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.\n\nThe game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.\n\nThe display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).\n\nThe winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "189661", "name": "Targi: The Action Tokens"}, {"id": "202453", "name": "Targi: The Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 13750, "average": 7.64588, "bayesaverage": 7.41956, "stddev": 1.0924, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21325, "trading": 205, "wanting": 891, "wishing": 4361, "numcomments": 2383, "numweights": 475, "averageweight": 2.3453, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 122}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 94}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 128, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 83}, "2": {"best_rating": 120, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 88}}}, "usersrated": 13750.0, "average": 7.64588, "bayesaverage": 7.41956, "stddev": 1.0924, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21325.0, "trading": 205.0, "wanting": 891.0, "wishing": 4361.0, "numcomments": 2383.0, "numweights": 475.0, "averageweight": 2.3453, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 122}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 94}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false}, {"id": "5405", "name": "Carcassonne: Expansion 2 \u2013 Traders & Builders", "alternative_names": ["Carcassonne: 2.

Players collect one of these goods when the feature that has it on the tile is scored. Players with the most of each type of good gets bonus points at the end of the game. There is a popular house rule that allows the trading of goods between players in exchange for other goods and the ability to chose where a tile is placed. There are also two new wooden playing pieces in this expansion.  The Builder is like a meeple in that it may be placed in a city or road as a kind of supervisor. A subsequent tile extension of the feature the Builder is in allows the player another tile placement. Farmers will also be able to place a new Pig pawn in a field for extra points at the end of the game.\n\nFinally, Traders & Builders comes with a large cloth bag. Not only does this make it easier to keep and handle the tiles, but it also removes the problem of having non-identical backsides.\n\nCarcassonne: Traders & Builders Expansion Play Summary\n\n\n     Traders - Some of the new city tiles depict goods: wine, grain and/or cloth. When you complete a city, your own or someone else's, you collect a matching token for each good in the city. At game end, whoever has the most goods in each category scores an additional 10 points.\n     Builders - Each player receives a builder meeple in his color.

Kennedy\n\nIn 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new \"superpowers\" scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.\n\nTwilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?\n\nTwilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.\n\nComponents (original edition):\n\n\n     228 full colour counters \n     22\"x34\" full colour map \n     103 event cards \n     2 six-sided dice\n     1 24-page rulebook\n     2 full colour player aid cards\n\n\nComponents (2009 Deluxe edition and after)\n\n     260 full colour counters \n     22\"x34\" mounted map with revised graphics\n     110 event cards\n     2 six-sided dice\n     1 24-page rulebook\n     2 full colour player aid cards\n\n\n\n\nTIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn\nMAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system\nUNIT SCALE:     Influence markers\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2\n\nDESIGNER: Ananda Gupta & Jason Matthews\nMAP, CARD, & COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch\n\n\nA deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:\n\n     Mounted map with revised graphics\n     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters\n     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)\n     Revised rules and player aid cards\n     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:\n\n     Mounted Map with revised graphics\n     New card decks\n     Updated Rules & Charts\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "117145", "name": "Twilight Struggle: \"Anni di Piombo\" Promo Card"}, {"id": "227688", "name": "Twilight Struggle: \"Gladio\" Promo Card"}, {"id": "151546", "name": "Twilight Struggle: \"Pakt Bagdadzki\" and \"Stan Wojenny\" Promo Cards"}, {"id": "123262", "name": "Twilight Struggle: \"Referendum NATO\" Promo Card"}, {"id": "280500", "name": "Twilight Struggle: \"\u0424\u0438\u043d\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\" Promo Card"}, {"id": "190581", "name": "Twilight Struggle: Promo Deck"}, {"id": "199869", "name": "Twilight Struggle: Regime of the Colonels Promo Card"}, {"id": "163247", "name": "Twilight Struggle: Turn Zero"}, {"id": "224686", "name": "Twilight Struggle: Turn Zero and Promo Packs"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2005, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 40001, "average": 8.29548, "bayesaverage": 8.13858, "stddev": 1.581, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54964, "trading": 878, "wanting": 1356, "wishing": 10140, "numcomments": 8672, "numweights": 3524, "averageweight": 3.5826, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 9}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 9}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 754, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 500}, "2": {"best_rating": 703, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "2+": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 487}}}, "usersrated": 40001.0, "average": 8.29548, "bayesaverage": 8.13858, "stddev": 1.581, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54964.0, "trading": 878.0, "wanting": 1356.0, "wishing": 10140.0, "numcomments": 8672.0, "numweights": 3524.0, "averageweight": 3.5826, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 9}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 9}], "game_family": "Twilight Struggle", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "12493", "name": "Twilight Imperium: Third Edition", "alternative_names": ["\u5e1d\u56fd\u66d9\u5149\uff08\u7b2c\u4e09\u7248\uff09"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHeQQrbauUVsvh2QF6PMog__thumb/img/9dc8SjfrB38KrNsuHd_JZOXnwYk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4128153.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHeQQrbauUVsvh2QF6PMog__original/img/60YjBskGAQNmZP7sedVoXneBjZg=/0x0/pic4128153.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Interplanetary or Interstellar scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Game: Twilight Imperium", "Mechanism: 4X", "Series: Fantasy Flight Big Box"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Negotiation", "Political", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Wargame"], "implementations": ["Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition", "Twilight Imperium: Second Edition"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area-Impulse", "Dice Rolling", "Follow", "Hexagon Grid", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Modular Board", "Player Elimination", "Tile Placement", "Trading", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "designers": ["Christian T.

Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.\n\nTI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of Catan, while the \"Command\" system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.\n\nPart of the Twilight Imperium Series.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition\n\n\n\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Shattered Empire\n    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Shards of the Throne\n\n\n\n\nRe-implemented in:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "95802", "name": "Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shards of the Throne"}, {"id": "22821", "name": "Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shattered Empire"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2005, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 240, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 240, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 18169, "average": 7.83842, "bayesaverage": 7.58656, "stddev": 1.70124, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19971, "trading": 712, "wanting": 671, "wishing": 4619, "numcomments": 4305, "numweights": 2044, "averageweight": 4.2515, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 75}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 21}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 72}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 478, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 270}, "2": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 269}, "3": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 148, "not_recommended_rating": 182}, "4": {"best_rating": 111, "recommended_rating": 247, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "5": {"best_rating": 57, "recommended_rating": 258, "not_recommended_rating": 58}, "6": {"best_rating": 338, "recommended_rating": 78, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "6+": {"best_rating": 42, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 117}}}, "usersrated": 18169.0, "average": 7.83842, "bayesaverage": 7.58656, "stddev": 1.70124, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19971.0, "trading": 712.0, "wanting": 671.0, "wishing": 4619.0, "numcomments": 4305.0, "numweights": 2044.0, "averageweight": 4.2515, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 75}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 21}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 72}], "game_family": "Twilight Imperium", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "247763", "name": "Underwater Cities", "alternative_names": ["Cidades submersas", "Podmo\u0159sk\u00e1 m\u011bsta", "Podwodne Miasta", "V\u00edz alatti v\u00e1rosok", "\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30ba", "\u6c34\u4e0b\u57ce\u5e02 Underwater Cities", "\uc5b8\ub354\uc6cc\ud130 \uc2dc\ud2f0\uc988"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__thumb/img/1gGYiRBx7W4wyLy826EHGTdjsKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4837710.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__original/img/LCsuq0PJ4JEVyrV5YSaLqaIkGv0=/0x0/pic4837710.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Under the Sea"], "categories": ["Card Game", "City Building", "Civilization", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Nautical", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["End Game Bonuses", "Hand Management", "Income", "Network and Route Building", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Turn Order: Stat-Based", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Vladim\u00edr Such\u00fd"], "artists": ["Uildrim", "Milan Vavro\u0148"], "publishers": ["Delicious Games", "Arrakis Games", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hobby World", "MeepleBR", "MINDOK", "MS Edizioni", "MYBG Co., Ltd.", "Portal Games", "Rio Grande Games", "sternenschimmermeer", "\u6570\u5bc4\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Suki Games)"], "description": "In Underwater Cities, which takes about 30-45 minutes per player, players represent the most powerful brains in the world, brains nominated due to the overpopulation of Earth to establish the best and most livable underwater areas possible.\n\nThe main principle of the game is card placement. Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color.

Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's \"A-cards\"; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.\n\nAll of the nearly 220 cards \u2014 whether special or basic \u2014 are divided into five types according to the way and time of use.

You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.\n\nYou start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!\n\nFor an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down.

A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute. For example, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but three different shapes, shadings, and colors, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.\n\nTo play, one person takes the deck and lays out twelve cards face up. The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so. After someone has claimed a set, the cardholder lays out three more cards. (If all players agree that no sets can be claimed, then the cardholder lays out three more cards. These cards aren't replaced after someone claims a set.)

In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file.  A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.\n\nNote: There are some early versions of Clue which are labeled as 2-6 players.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1949, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 17167, "average": 5.66807, "bayesaverage": 5.57013, "stddev": 1.49045, "median": 0.0, "owned": 30052, "trading": 549, "wanting": 35, "wishing": 330, "numcomments": 4347, "numweights": 1159, "averageweight": 1.6592, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 8416}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 1843}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 154, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 118}, "2": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 108}, "3": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 92, "not_recommended_rating": 29}, "4": {"best_rating": 85, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 82, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "6": {"best_rating": 61, "recommended_rating": 58, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 84}}}, "usersrated": 17167.0, "average": 5.66807, "bayesaverage": 5.57013, "stddev": 1.49045, "median": 0.0, "owned": 30052.0, "trading": 549.0, "wanting": 35.0, "wishing": 330.0, "numcomments": 4347.0, "numweights": 1159.0, "averageweight": 1.6592, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 8416}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 1843}], "game_family": "Cluedo / Clue (Parker Brothers, et al)", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "1406", "name": "Monopoly", "alternative_names": ["\u00c5lborg p\u00e5 spil", "Banco Imobili\u00e1rio", "Banco Imobili\u00e1rio Brasil", "Banco Imobili\u00e1rio: Luxo", "Beuru Mabeul", "C\u1edd Ph\u00fa \u00d4ng", "C\u1edd T\u1ef7 Ph\u00fa", "Deluxe Monopoly", "La Gran Capital", "Gute Reise Monopoly", "Inspopoly", "Kleppspelet", "Matador", "Matador De Luxe", "Metropoli", "Millionaire", "Million\u00e6r", "Monopol", "Monopol de Luxe", "Monopoli", "Monopoli: Edizione Europea", "Monopoli: Nopean sijoittajan kiinteist\u00f6peli", "Monopolio", "Monopoly (Madrid/Barcelona)", "Monopoly 60", "Monopoly Token Madness", "Monopoly \u0398\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2", "Monopoly: 1935 Deluxe", "Monopoly: 1935 Retro", "Monopoly: 25th Anniversary", "Monopoly: 60th Anniversary Edition (1935-1995)", "Monopoly: 65th Anniversary 1935-2000", "Monopoly: 85th Anniversary Edition", "Monopoly: Das ber\u00fchmte Gesellschaftsspiel", "Monopoly: Das ber\u00fchmte Gesellschaftsspiel, \u00d6sterreich Ausgabe", "Monopoly: Deluxe Anniversary Edition", "Monopoly: General Mills Collector's Edition", "Monopoly: Lietuva", "Monopoly: Replik der deutschen Ausgabe von 1936", "Monopoly: South African Edition", "Monopoly: Standard Tunisian", "Monopoly: Swedish", "Monopoly: Swiss Edition", "Orkdalspillet", "Sandnesspillet", "Stavangerspillet", "World Business", "\u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03ce\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf", "\u041c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u044f", "\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430", "\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc", "\u30e2\u30ce\u30dd\u30ea\u30fc", "\u5927\u5bcc\u7fc1/\u5f3a\u624b\u68cb", "\ubaa8\ub178\ud3f4\ub9ac", "\ubaa8\ub178\ud3f4\ub9ac \ub118\ubc84 \uc6d0", "\ubaa8\ub178\ud3f4\ub9ac \ud074\ub798\uc2dd"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9nGoBZ0MRbi6rdH47sj2Qg__thumb/img/ezXcyEsHhS9iRxmuGe8SmiLLXlM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5786795.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9nGoBZ0MRbi6rdH47sj2Qg__original/img/Gm2aNviahMmKvE1lerFOJjKf7ZY=/0x0/pic5786795.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Monopoly (Official)", "Series: Nostalgia (Hasbro)", "Brands: Groceries", "Country: Poland", "Country: Sweden", "Country: Switzerland", "Promotional: Promo Board Games", "Series: Monopoly-Like", "Theme: Cereal Games"], "categories": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "implementations": ["Monopoly City", "Monopoly Empire", "Monopoly for Millennials", "Monopoly Gamer", "Monopoly Jackpot", "Monopoly Jenga", "Monopoly L.O.L.

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.\n\nGameplay\nOn his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\n\nGoal\nThe goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.\n\nCultural impact on rules\nMonopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take \"loans\" from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.\n\nBackground\nIn the USA in 1933, Charles Darrow devised Monopoly based on an earlier game by Elizabeth J. Magie. The patent was filed 31st August 1935 while the game was on sale in America. Based on an earlier game, The Landlord's Game, it was at first rejected by Parker Bros., as being too complicated to be a success. How wrong could they be! It came to the UK in 1936, made under licence by Waddingtons. Darrow died in 1967 having realised he had developed one of the most successful board games of all times. It was awarded as Game of the Century by the TRA (Toy Retailers Association).\n\nMonopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show the evils of earning money from renting land (as it leads to the destitution of all but one player) and the virtues of the proposed Single Tax - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate \"Single Tax\" rules.\n\nThe game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow, who introduced it to the world in its current form.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    The Landlord's Game\n\n\n\n\nExpanded by:\nOfficial\n\n    Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on\n    Monopoly Free Parking Mini Game\n    Monopoly Get Out of Jail Mini Game\n\n\n\n\nUnofficial\n\n    Super Add-Ons: Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)\n    Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)\n    Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion (fan expansion for Monopoly)\n    Mafiopoly\n    Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck\n    Final Fantasy Monopoly\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "138841", "name": "Bance!"}, {"id": "21659", "name": "Beyond Boardwalk and Park Place (fan expansion for Monopoly)"}, {"id": "208031", "name": "Cardopoly"}, {"id": "13102", "name": "Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)"}, {"id": "3446", "name": "Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion (fan expansion for Monopoly)"}, {"id": "96025", "name": "Infla: Defla"}, {"id": "28968", "name": "Mafiopoly"}, {"id": "9466", "name": "Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on"}, {"id": "37893", "name": "Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck"}, {"id": "200771", "name": "Socialism: The Game (fan expansion for Monopoly)"}, {"id": "16775", "name": "Super Add-Ons: Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1933, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 27890, "average": 4.36842, "bayesaverage": 4.30576, "stddev": 1.84652, "median": 0.0, "owned": 37819, "trading": 454, "wanting": 24, "wishing": 311, "numcomments": 6493, "numweights": 1822, "averageweight": 1.652, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 19936}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 2132}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 263, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 210}, "2": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 76, "not_recommended_rating": 142}, "3": {"best_rating": 42, "recommended_rating": 139, "not_recommended_rating": 48}, "4": {"best_rating": 183, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "5": {"best_rating": 56, "recommended_rating": 125, "not_recommended_rating": 44}, "6": {"best_rating": 31, "recommended_rating": 100, "not_recommended_rating": 88}, "7": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 36, "not_recommended_rating": 155}, "8": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 164}, "8+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 172}}}, "usersrated": 27890.0, "average": 4.36842, "bayesaverage": 4.30576, "stddev": 1.84652, "median": 0.0, "owned": 37819.0, "trading": 454.0, "wanting": 24.0, "wishing": 311.0, "numcomments": 6493.0, "numweights": 1822.0, "averageweight": 1.652, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 19936}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 2132}], "game_family": "Monopoly (Official)", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 11, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "1465", "name": "Wizard", "alternative_names": ["\u010carodej", "Fantasy Wizard", "Wizard 25 Jahre Jubil\u00e4umsedition", "Wizard Jubil\u00e4umsedition", "Wizard: gra przepowiedni", "Wizard: \u039c\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03af", "\u039c\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03af", "\u041c\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435", "\u30a6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9", "\u5deb\u5e2b", "\u795e\u673a\u5999\u7b97", "\uc704\uc790\ub4dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ygVQlepjPxyg7IizSCM_Tw__thumb/img/1qmNhxNzPDSu_Am2rmIobVe9J1M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5948.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ygVQlepjPxyg7IizSCM_Tw__original/img/Uk2J7VGDyGMt6O3H_Pkt41GSlmQ=/0x0/pic5948.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Wizard (Amigo)"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": ["Wizard Junior", "Wizard W\u00fcrfelspiel", "Wizard: Jubil\u00e4umsedition"], "mechanics": ["Betting and Bluffing", "Hand Management", "Trick-taking"], "designers": ["Ken Fisher"], "artists": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "publishers": ["K.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards \u2014 one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. \u2014 then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose \"no trump\". On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.\n\nThe playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.\n\nAfter each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.\n\nAfter all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.\n\nA common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "189897", "name": "Wizard: The Christmas Wizards"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1984, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 8142, "average": 6.92335, "bayesaverage": 6.66617, "stddev": 1.39601, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13515, "trading": 327, "wanting": 37, "wishing": 361, "numcomments": 1797, "numweights": 500, "averageweight": 1.734, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 755}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 203}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 115, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 82}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 79}, "3": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "4": {"best_rating": 73, "recommended_rating": 36, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "5": {"best_rating": 64, "recommended_rating": 40, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "6": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 66}}}, "usersrated": 8142.0, "average": 6.92335, "bayesaverage": 6.66617, "stddev": 1.39601, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13515.0, "trading": 327.0, "wanting": 37.0, "wishing": 361.0, "numcomments": 1797.0, "numweights": 500.0, "averageweight": 1.734, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 755}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 203}], "game_family": "Wizard (Amigo)", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "54998", "name": "Cyclades", "alternative_names": ["Cyklady", "Kyklades", "\u039a\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2", "\u041a\u0438\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b", "\u7fa4\u5cf6\u722d\u9738"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QbaJOS8acWkJ6gSYI0KaQ__thumb/img/YSxmsx_zxqdVoqNVGsNnAqyH1lc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic584779.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QbaJOS8acWkJ6gSYI0KaQ__original/img/vNjql8aAkLhcsSx6YWPnHxiHrs4=/0x0/pic584779.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Country: Greece", "Creatures: Minotaurs", "Game: Cyclades", "Islands: Cyclades (Greece)", "Mythology: Greek"], "categories": ["Ancient", "City Building", "Civilization", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Mythology", "Nautical"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Auction: Fixed Placement", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Variable Phase Order"], "designers": ["Bruno Cathala", "Ludovic Maublanc"], "artists": ["Miguel Coimbra"], "publishers": ["Matagot", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Bureau de Juegos", "CrowD Games", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Lex Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "REXhry", "Surfin' Meeple China", "\u0412\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438"], "description": "In this latest collaboration between Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, players must buy the favor of the gods in their race to be the first player to build two cities in the Ancient Greek island group known as the Cyclades.\n\nVictory requires respect for all the gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one god, but must pay homage to each of five gods in turn.

At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.\n\nOn a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.\n\nThe 2016 edition of Citadels includes twenty-seven characters \u2014 eight from the original Citadels, ten from the Dark City expansion, and nine new ones \u2014 along with thirty unique building districts, and the rulebook includes six preset lists of characters and districts beyond the starter list, each crafted to encourage a different style and intensity of gameplay.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 8, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 7080, "average": 7.31442, "bayesaverage": 6.92152, "stddev": 1.26604, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13293, "trading": 212, "wanting": 180, "wishing": 1855, "numcomments": 1017, "numweights": 142, "averageweight": 1.993, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 467}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 100}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 129, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 81}, "2": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 51}, "3": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 21}, "4": {"best_rating": 37, "recommended_rating": 64, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 41, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "6": {"best_rating": 39, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "7": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 38, "not_recommended_rating": 31}, "8": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 28, "not_recommended_rating": 48}, "8+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 59}}}, "usersrated": 7080.0, "average": 7.31442, "bayesaverage": 6.92152, "stddev": 1.26604, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13293.0, "trading": 212.0, "wanting": 180.0, "wishing": 1855.0, "numcomments": 1017.0, "numweights": 142.0, "averageweight": 1.993, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 467}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 100}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "160477", "name": "Onitama", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FZdihu8SibqQYtwfo77BdQ__thumb/img/3fX3AN6UMOIASL3Qev3zsQ6Uxy8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5032361.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FZdihu8SibqQYtwfo77BdQ__original/img/jznzLfy3vTVhTzzPLDIIuZY-el0=/0x0/pic5032361.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Components: 5 x 5 Grids", "Game: Onitama", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Series: Dice Tower Essentials"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Ancient"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Pattern Movement", "Static Capture"], "designers": ["Shimpei Sato"], "artists": ["Jun Kondo", "Mariusz Szmerdt"], "publishers": ["conception", "Arcane Wonders", "Igiari", "Maldito Games", "minimalGames", "Pegasus Spiele", "Raven Distribution"], "description": "Onitama is a two-player, perfect information abstract game with a random starting set-up.

As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.\n\nWhat's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve \"Fame\", which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.\n\nThe game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.\n\nThe monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.\n\nPart of the King of Tokyo series.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "167897", "name": "King of New York: 55 Central Park West"}, {"id": "174149", "name": "King of New York: Force of Unnature"}, {"id": "173363", "name": "King of New York: Hibernation"}, {"id": "167896", "name": "King of New York: Improvised Weapons"}, {"id": "164247", "name": "King of New York: Monster Idol"}, {"id": "174148", "name": "King of New York: Nano Bots"}, {"id": "174147", "name": "King of New York: New York City Defender"}, {"id": "193320", "name": "King of New York: Power Up!"}, {"id": "178739", "name": "King of New York: Promo Cards"}, {"id": "210967", "name": "King of New York: Sewer Crocs"}, {"id": "173362", "name": "King of New York: St. George Theater"}, {"id": "174151", "name": "King of New York: Trump Tower"}, {"id": "174150", "name": "King of New York: U.N.

Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.\n\nThis is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.\n\nEach turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player\u2019s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "310777", "name": "Gloomhaven: Beyond the End of the World (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "312638", "name": "Gloomhaven: Curse of the Lost Cabal (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "312632", "name": "Gloomhaven: Dice Tower 2020 Kickstarter (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "250337", "name": "Gloomhaven: Forgotten Circles"}, {"id": "312635", "name": "Gloomhaven: No Pun Included 2019 Kickstarter (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "298195", "name": "Gloomhaven: Return of the Lost Cabal (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "297586", "name": "Gloomhaven: Secrets of the Lost Cabal (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "226868", "name": "Gloomhaven: Solo Scenarios"}, {"id": "310773", "name": "Gloomhaven: The Catacombs of Chaos (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "231934", "name": "Gloomhaven: The End of the World (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "300402", "name": "Gloomhaven: The Lucky Meeple (Promo Scenario)"}, {"id": "310754", "name": "Gloomhaven: The Tower of Misfortune (Promo Scenario)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 39911, "average": 8.8033, "bayesaverage": 8.55921, "stddev": 1.61003, "median": 0.0, "owned": 64709, "trading": 435, "wanting": 1402, "wishing": 15636, "numcomments": 7384, "numweights": 1730, "averageweight": 3.8538, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1058, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 110, "recommended_rating": 453, "not_recommended_rating": 233}, "2": {"best_rating": 241, "recommended_rating": 593, "not_recommended_rating": 59}, "3": {"best_rating": 511, "recommended_rating": 352, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "4": {"best_rating": 334, "recommended_rating": 411, "not_recommended_rating": 111}, "4+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 576}}}, "usersrated": 39911.0, "average": 8.8033, "bayesaverage": 8.55921, "stddev": 1.61003, "median": 0.0, "owned": 64709.0, "trading": 435.0, "wanting": 1402.0, "wishing": 15636.0, "numcomments": 7384.0, "numweights": 1730.0, "averageweight": 3.8538, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 1}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 1}], "game_family": "Gloomhaven", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 12, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "91514", "name": "Rhino Hero", "alternative_names": ["Rhino Hero Giant Edition", "Rino Ercolino", "Super Rhino!", "Super Rino!", "SuperRino", "\u039f \u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03b1\u03c2: \u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2!", "\u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433", "\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c6\u30f3\u30fb\u30ea\u30ce", "\u8d85\u7d1a\u7280\u725b", "\uc288\ud37c\ub77c\uc774\ub178", "\uc288\ud37c\ub77c\uc774\ub178"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fquWcV6MjSAYh9H_o5hHOg__thumb/img/1UqLGx_AjT-tZBRrl6IgODwj15I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1010030.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fquWcV6MjSAYh9H_o5hHOg__original/img/t5O7NJLwlcc703k8Ij-PktJor2o=/0x0/pic1010030.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Rhinoceroses", "Components: 3-Dimensional (3D)", "Mechanism: Tower Stacking", "Series: Mitbringspiel Mini (HABA)", "Theme: Anthropomorphic Animals"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "Animals", "Children's Game", "Party Game"], "implementations": ["Rhino Hero Junior"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Stacking and Balancing"], "designers": ["Scott Frisco", "Steven Strumpf"], "artists": ["Thies Schwarz"], "publishers": ["HABA", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Nabita World co., Ltd.", "Reflexshop", "Sugorokuya", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "Super Rhino! presents players with an incredibly heroic \u2013 and regrettably heavy \u2013 rhinoceros who is eager to climb a tall building and leap other tall buildings in a single bound.

Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you\u2019re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.\n\nAlternate Description of Quarriors\n\nIn Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form \"the Wilds\" in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.\n\nQuarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "133565", "name": "Quarriors!

Points are scored mostly by painting the fresco, which requires specific combinations of paints, so you'll need to buy and mix your paints wisely, in addition to beating other players to the paints and fresco segments you would like to paint.\n\nFresco includes several expansion modules, so you can play without expansions for a lighter family game or add in expansions to vary play and increase the decision-making and difficulty, resulting in a very flexible game with a high replay value.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "292012", "name": "Fresco: Expansion Box 12-17"}, {"id": "86048", "name": "Fresco: Expansion Module 7 \u2013 The Scrolls"}, {"id": "85925", "name": "Fresco: Expansion Modules 4, 5 and 6"}, {"id": "148289", "name": "Fresco: Expansion Modules 8, 9 and 10"}, {"id": "109140", "name": "Fresco: The Bishop's Favor"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 11683, "average": 7.28848, "bayesaverage": 7.07252, "stddev": 1.14115, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14168, "trading": 466, "wanting": 489, "wishing": 2341, "numcomments": 2445, "numweights": 658, "averageweight": 2.6383, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 324}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 228}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 58}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 187, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 88}, "2": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 77, "not_recommended_rating": 61}, "3": {"best_rating": 69, "recommended_rating": 82, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 129, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 72}}}, "usersrated": 11683.0, "average": 7.28848, "bayesaverage": 7.07252, "stddev": 1.14115, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14168.0, "trading": 466.0, "wanting": 489.0, "wishing": 2341.0, "numcomments": 2445.0, "numweights": 658.0, "averageweight": 2.6383, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 324}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 228}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 58}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "66362", "name": "Glen More", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ApDYRpgfdCMhEszegyHiEA__thumb/img/8E82w4RfXAuRIvmnPVGE0or3rQQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1013640.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ApDYRpgfdCMhEszegyHiEA__original/img/W2LIAOd9GntolWuLi-j0flI2SwE=/0x0/pic1013640.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Meeples (Black)", "Components: Meeples (Blue)", "Components: Meeples (Green)", "Components: Meeples (Red)", "Components: Meeples (Yellow)", "Country: Scotland", "Game: Glen More", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Series: Alea Medium Box"], "categories": ["City Building", "Economic", "Farming"], "implementations": ["Glen More II: Chronicles"], "mechanics": ["Commodity Speculation", "Dice Rolling", "Rondel", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement", "Time Track", "Track Movement"], "designers": ["Matthias Cramer"], "artists": ["Lo\u00efc Billiau", "Harald Lieske"], "publishers": ["alea", "Ravensburger", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "Each player represents the leadership of a 17th century Scottish clan looking to expand its territory and its wealth.

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. \nDominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. \nEach player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes\u2014mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won\u2019t last: It is indeed \"survival of the fittest\".\nThrough wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. \nAll of this eventually leads to the end game\u2014the final ascent of the ice age\u2014where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. \nBut somebody better become dominant quickly, because it\u2019s getting mighty cold...\n\nGame Play\nThe large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles\u2014converting them into tundra in the process\u2014as the ice age encroaches.\nThe cylindrical action pawns (or \"AP\"s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.\nGenerally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal\u2019s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents\u2019\u2014hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or \"VP\"s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.\nThroughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the \"earth\"). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. \nWhen the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile\u2014after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 240, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 240, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 17788, "average": 7.84691, "bayesaverage": 7.63664, "stddev": 1.50798, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19098, "trading": 371, "wanting": 1238, "wishing": 6615, "numcomments": 3915, "numweights": 1428, "averageweight": 4.0378, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 61}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 52}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 472, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 239}, "2": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 121, "not_recommended_rating": 173}, "3": {"best_rating": 73, "recommended_rating": 230, "not_recommended_rating": 48}, "4": {"best_rating": 263, "recommended_rating": 134, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "5": {"best_rating": 104, "recommended_rating": 198, "not_recommended_rating": 51}, "6": {"best_rating": 97, "recommended_rating": 135, "not_recommended_rating": 111}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 182}}}, "usersrated": 17788.0, "average": 7.84691, "bayesaverage": 7.63664, "stddev": 1.50798, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19098.0, "trading": 371.0, "wanting": 1238.0, "wishing": 6615.0, "numcomments": 3915.0, "numweights": 1428.0, "averageweight": 4.0378, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 61}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 52}], "game_family": "Dominant Species", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "291457", "name": "Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion", "alternative_names": ["Gloomhaven: Die Pranken des L\u00f6wen", "Gloomhaven: W szcz\u0119kach lwa"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_HhIdavYW-hid20Iq3hhmg__thumb/img/OMkN_E5eyWrkID_cHCnQEbIixGM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5055631.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_HhIdavYW-hid20Iq3hhmg__original/img/FHpPH2vPw6VAJGodpGaQYOdTGIg=/0x0/pic5055631.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler", "Components: Book as Board", "Game: Gloomhaven", "Mechanism: Legacy", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Cooperative Game", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Hexagon Grid", "Legacy Game", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Solo / Solitaire Game"], "designers": ["Isaac Childres"], "artists": ["Francesca Baerald", "Cat Bock", "David Bock", "David Demaret", "Alexandr Elichev", "Jason D.

The board is modular, which changes the layout of the town and start positions of each hero. The game comes with several scenarios, which include simple survival, rescue, or escape. Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability.\n\nA hero deck and a zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using six-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards with which heroes may be equipped. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie.

At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!\n\nSeasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:\n\nThe first phase \"Prelude\" consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.\n\nOnce the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.\n\nNext comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).\n\nThese cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: \n- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) \n- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards\n- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. \n- Draw new cards\n\nEach player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the \"time track\" would move forward.\nIn addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the \"exchange rates\" of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.\n\nAt the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable). The highest score wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "163326", "name": "Seasons: Crystal Titan"}, {"id": "136233", "name": "Seasons: Enchanted Kingdom"}, {"id": "172153", "name": "Seasons: Geek d'Argos"}, {"id": "164015", "name": "Seasons: Igramul the Banisher"}, {"id": "166375", "name": "Seasons: Orb of Ragfield"}, {"id": "148166", "name": "Seasons: Path of Destiny"}, {"id": "164203", "name": "Seasons: Speedwall the Escaped"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 20383, "average": 7.41104, "bayesaverage": 7.24628, "stddev": 1.36248, "median": 0.0, "owned": 24026, "trading": 527, "wanting": 769, "wishing": 4764, "numcomments": 3343, "numweights": 884, "averageweight": 2.7715, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 208}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 157}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 472, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 223}, "2": {"best_rating": 319, "recommended_rating": 111, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "3": {"best_rating": 129, "recommended_rating": 244, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "4": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 150, "not_recommended_rating": 183}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 202}}}, "usersrated": 20383.0, "average": 7.41104, "bayesaverage": 7.24628, "stddev": 1.36248, "median": 0.0, "owned": 24026.0, "trading": 527.0, "wanting": 769.0, "wishing": 4764.0, "numcomments": 3343.0, "numweights": 884.0, "averageweight": 2.7715, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 208}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 157}], "game_family": "Seasons", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "232043", "name": "Queendomino", "alternative_names": ["Queendomino XL", "\u05e7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05df\u05d3\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5", "\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30f3\u30c9\u30df\u30ce", "\u591a\u7c73\u8afe\u5973\u738b", "\ud038\ub3c4\ubbf8\ub178"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_6VtTmeI4e7cORxFWRC7Og__thumb/img/uzS2wD_CvrjO8KQsNZDoT0RBvmY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3672901.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_6VtTmeI4e7cORxFWRC7Og__original/img/7iJggCgPERAUdyJvM-eJhBvzCUk=/0x0/pic3672901.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Kingdomino"], "categories": ["City Building", "Fantasy", "Medieval", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Enclosure", "Tile Placement", "Variable Phase Order"], "designers": ["Bruno Cathala"], "artists": ["Cyril Bouquet"], "publishers": ["Blackrock Games", "Blue Orange (EU)", "Blue Orange Games", "FoxGames", "FoxMind", "FoxMind Israel", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Happy Baobab", "MINDOK", "PaperGames (III)", "Pegasus Spiele", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)", "White Goblin Games"], "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nBuild up the most prestigious kingdom by claiming wheat fields, forests, lakes, grazing grounds, marshes, and mountains.

Possible actions include: move on the map (how far depends on whether they have a mount), doing a location-specific action (such as mine for gold if they are at a gold mine, gamble if they're in a saloon, etc.), fight other players at the same location (either duel them, rob them, or arrest them if they're wanted), play poker cards that have action abilities, etc. Legendary Points (LPs) are earned based on the outcomes of many of these actions, and the winner is whoever has the most LPs at the end of the game.\n\nKey Points\n- Award-Winning gaming experience set in the American West!\n- Beautiful artwork, and presentation brings this highly thematic game to life.\n- Intuitive gameplay and choices let\u2019s you write your own legend every game!\n\nNote: The Russian edition of Western Legends contains 2 expansions packaged inside the box, therefore it has its own entry here: \u00d0\u203a\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00b4\u00d1\u2039 \u00d0\u00b4\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00be \u00d0\u00b7\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00bf\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00b4\u00d0\u00b0\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "267545", "name": "Western Legends: Ante Up"}, {"id": "295026", "name": "Western Legends: Blood Money"}, {"id": "272254", "name": "Western Legends: Carbine Promo Cards"}, {"id": "244936", "name": "Western Legends: Fistful of Extras"}, {"id": "272253", "name": "Western Legends: Man in Black Promo Card"}, {"id": "244935", "name": "Western Legends: The Good, the Bad, and the Handsome"}, {"id": "307233", "name": "Western Legends: The Man In Black \u2013 Multiplayer Variant Promo Cards"}, {"id": "270728", "name": "Western Legends: Wild Bunch of Extras"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2018, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 6082, "average": 7.67044, "bayesaverage": 7.17395, "stddev": 1.42242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10291, "trading": 123, "wanting": 622, "wishing": 3606, "numcomments": 1231, "numweights": 154, "averageweight": 2.7792, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 247}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 55}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 147, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 92}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 79}, "3": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 73, "not_recommended_rating": 23}, "4": {"best_rating": 94, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 41, "recommended_rating": 58, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "6": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 60}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 69}}}, "usersrated": 6082.0, "average": 7.67044, "bayesaverage": 7.17395, "stddev": 1.42242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10291.0, "trading": 123.0, "wanting": 622.0, "wishing": 3606.0, "numcomments": 1231.0, "numweights": 154.0, "averageweight": 2.7792, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 247}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 55}], "game_family": "Western Legends", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false}, {"id": "40692", "name": "Small World", "alternative_names": ["\u041c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440", "\u0e42\u0e25\u0e01\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01", "\u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9", "\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c", "\u5c0f\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aoPM07XzoceB-RydLh08zA__thumb/img/o3Bw9heVDJRgPYlI_PksCvLAgnM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic428828.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aoPM07XzoceB-RydLh08zA__original/img/WvXe0YG-Mj2KBtyRSBNtRw4DIx0=/0x0/pic428828.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Continental / National scale)", "Game: Small World"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Fighting", "Territory Building"], "implementations": ["Small World Designer Edition", "Small World of Warcraft", "Vinci"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Variable Player Powers", "Victory Points as a Resource"], "designers": ["Philippe Keyaerts"], "artists": ["Miguel Coimbra", "Cyrille Daujean"], "publishers": ["Days of Wonder", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)", "Compaya.hu -

often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!\n\nOn each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go \"into decline\". A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.\n\nAt the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.\n\nClarifications: available in a pinned forum post.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "65490", "name": "Community's Compendium I (fan expansion for Small World)"}, {"id": "66640", "name": "Community's Compendium II (fan expansion for Small World)"}, {"id": "64592", "name": "Random Map Expansion (fan expansion for Small World)"}, {"id": "149066", "name": "Small World: 6 Player Board"}, {"id": "165458", "name": "Small World: A Spider's Web"}, {"id": "81618", "name": "Small World: Be Not Afraid..."}, {"id": "57072", "name": "Small World: Cursed!"}, {"id": "57070", "name": "Small World: Grand Dames of Small World"}, {"id": "60054", "name": "Small World: Leaders of Small World"}, {"id": "84183", "name": "Small World: Necromancer Island"}, {"id": "241991", "name": "Small World: Power Pack 1"}, {"id": "241989", "name": "Small World: Power Pack 2"}, {"id": "122316", "name": "Small World: Realms"}, {"id": "207121", "name": "Small World: River World"}, {"id": "144171", "name": "Small World: Royal Bonus"}, {"id": "235520", "name": "Small World: Sky Islands"}, {"id": "71818", "name": "Small World: Tales and Legends"}, {"id": "109632", "name": "Small World: Tunnels"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2009, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 80, "minplaytime": 40, "maxplaytime": 80, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 60676, "average": 7.26581, "bayesaverage": 7.17465, "stddev": 1.3001, "median": 0.0, "owned": 80487, "trading": 1994, "wanting": 928, "wishing": 9006, "numcomments": 9658, "numweights": 3196, "averageweight": 2.3595, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 246}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 219}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 50}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 921, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 19, "not_recommended_rating": 539}, "2": {"best_rating": 110, "recommended_rating": 462, "not_recommended_rating": 209}, "3": {"best_rating": 280, "recommended_rating": 472, "not_recommended_rating": 28}, "4": {"best_rating": 577, "recommended_rating": 231, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "5": {"best_rating": 209, "recommended_rating": 446, "not_recommended_rating": 86}, "5+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 36, "not_recommended_rating": 372}}}, "usersrated": 60676.0, "average": 7.26581, "bayesaverage": 7.17465, "stddev": 1.3001, "median": 0.0, "owned": 80487.0, "trading": 1994.0, "wanting": 928.0, "wishing": 9006.0, "numcomments": 9658.0, "numweights": 3196.0, "averageweight": 2.3595, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 246}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 219}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 50}], "game_family": "Small World", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 18, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "40765", "name": "Clash of Cultures", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XHTMyEGDsNHLKXkbGDKaKA__thumb/img/mf5yep4EN9ZQP5hId2GsPB9zduo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1351042.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XHTMyEGDsNHLKXkbGDKaKA__original/img/0LpHb0FlftqsqMUDxB2x6nOJW9w=/0x0/pic1351042.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Mechanism: 4X"], "categories": ["Ancient", "City Building", "Civilization", "Economic", "Exploration", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks", "Trading"], "designers": ["Christian Marcussen"], "artists": ["Chris Quilliams"], "publishers": ["Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Z-Man Games, Inc.", "Ediciones MasQueOca"], "description": "From Christian Marcussen, the creator of Merchants and Marauders, comes Clash of Cultures, a civilization game in which each player leads a civilization from a single settlement to a mighty empire. Players must explore their surroundings, build large cities, research advances and conquer those who stand in the way. The game features a modular board for players to explore, 48 distinct advances, seven mighty wonders, and loads of miniatures and cards. The winner will create a culture that will be remembered and admired for millennia.\n\nAdvances\nThe game features about 48 distinct advances. The whole \"tech-tree\" is very flexible with no dead ends, yet still intuitive, sensible and \"realistic.\" Additionally you have a great overview of what advances other cultures have - no need to ask - just look.\n\nModular Board\nPlayers start with a civilization in its infancy. Move settlers to uncharted regions and reveal the terrain and its resources. Several mechanisms have been implemented to assure that an unlucky placement of region-tiles won't be a decider.\n\nPlaying Time\nThe game covers a time span similar to AH Civilization - that is to pre-gunpowder. This epic game is playable in about an hour per player! This is a pretty good playing time for a game that covers so much ground as this game will.\n\nCity management\nPlayers expand their cities through the game. But not just to the generic larger city. Players instead choose a building type which represents the growth of the city. For instance you can expand a city with a port, fort, temple and academy - all with different benefits! Additionally cities can be \"angry,\" \"neutral\" and \"happy.\" Everything integrated in an intuitive and elegant fashion.\n\nMultiple paths to victory\nEarn points through:\n- Founding cities and increasing their sizes\n- Advances\n- Objectives \n- Wonders\n- Events\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "146244", "name": "Clash of Cultures: Civilizations"}, {"id": "167825", "name": "Clash of Cultures: Civilizations \u2013 Aztecs"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 240, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 240, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 5139, "average": 7.623, "bayesaverage": 7.11073, "stddev": 1.42818, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6067, "trading": 219, "wanting": 489, "wishing": 2525, "numcomments": 1312, "numweights": 350, "averageweight": 3.5943, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 295}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 172}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 126, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 74}, "2": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 62, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "3": {"best_rating": 58, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 69, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 55}}}, "usersrated": 5139.0, "average": 7.623, "bayesaverage": 7.11073, "stddev": 1.42818, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6067.0, "trading": 219.0, "wanting": 489.0, "wishing": 2525.0, "numcomments": 1312.0, "numweights": 350.0, "averageweight": 3.5943, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 295}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 172}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "40834", "name": "Dominion: Intrigue", "alternative_names": ["Dominion: Die Intrige", "Dominion: Hovin juonet", "Dominion: Intriga", "Dominion: Intrige", "Dominion: Intrigo", "Dominion: Intrika", "Dominion: Intriky", "Dominion: Intryga", "Dominion: L'Intrigue", "\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043e\u043d: \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0430", "\u30c9\u30df\u30cb\u30aa\u30f3\uff1a\u9670\u8b00", "\u7687\u8f3f\u722d\u9738\u4e4b\u6697\u6f6e\u6d36\u6e67", "\ub3c4\ubbf8\ub2c8\uc5b8: \uc7a5\ub9c9 \ub4a4\uc758 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OGOmpi0GgwOwH2y28QgkuA__thumb/img/jnSHqOXWLN3PfdpCtnfjf44oTsA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic460011.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OGOmpi0GgwOwH2y28QgkuA__original/img/r0aALn-3X6WgRcnDqVxbxGSG0tw=/0x0/pic460011.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Wspieram", "Game: Dominion"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Medieval"], "implementations": ["Dominion: Intrigue (Second Edition)"], "mechanics": ["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "designers": ["Donald X.

They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.\n\nUsing worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers \u2014 the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices \u2013 obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.\n\nThe tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.\n\nThe game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations. The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.\n\nThe \"Dark Alley\" expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game. It also comes with 48 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 27 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "290975", "name": "Trickerion: Collector's Upgrade Pack"}, {"id": "244358", "name": "Trickerion: Dahlgaard's Academy"}, {"id": "172659", "name": "Trickerion: Dahlgaard's Gifts"}, {"id": "255743", "name": "Trickerion: Dawn of Technology"}, {"id": "266238", "name": "Trickerion: The Secret Workshop"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 6474, "average": 7.89501, "bayesaverage": 7.40527, "stddev": 1.43563, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9765, "trading": 132, "wanting": 589, "wishing": 2999, "numcomments": 1329, "numweights": 477, "averageweight": 4.1992, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 127}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 86}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 98, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 45}, "2": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "3": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 45, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 61, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 38}}}, "usersrated": 6474.0, "average": 7.89501, "bayesaverage": 7.40527, "stddev": 1.43563, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9765.0, "trading": 132.0, "wanting": 589.0, "wishing": 2999.0, "numcomments": 1329.0, "numweights": 477.0, "averageweight": 4.1992, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 127}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 86}], "game_family": "Trickerion", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "163412", "name": "Patchwork", "alternative_names": ["Patchwork: Americana Edition", "Patchwork: Edycja Zimowa", "Patchwork: Folklore China", "Patchwork: Folklore Taiwan", "Patchwork: T\u00e9li kiad\u00e1s", "Patchwork: Winter Edition", "Patchwork: \u03a7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1", "Tilkkut\u00e4kki", "Yamal\u0131 Yorgan", "\u041f\u0435\u0447\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043a", "\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05ea \u05d8\u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd", "\u30d1\u30c3\u30c1\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\uff1a\u51ac\u306e\u8d08\u308a\u7269", "\u62fc\u5e03\u85dd\u8853", "\u8865\u8865\u8d34\u8d34", "\ud328\uce58\uc6cc\ud06c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wLW7pFn0--20lEizEz5p3A__thumb/img/P49TUiytgjmRAtKsfO7Y3yU_xic=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2270442.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wLW7pFn0--20lEizEz5p3A__original/img/Z8MYZktgvGTtIikMv9HSpD_ERAI=/0x0/pic2270442.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Components: Polyominoes", "Game: Patchwork", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Series: Fur Zwei Spieler (Lookout Games)", "Theme: Sewing / Knitting / Cloth-Making"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Puzzle"], "implementations": ["Patchwork Express"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Grid Coverage", "Income", "Rondel", "Square Grid", "Tile Placement", "Time Track", "Victory Points as a Resource"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz", "Rex Lee", "Gru Tsow"], "publishers": ["Lookout Games", "999 Games", "Asmodee", "Asmodee Italia", "Brain Games", "Compaya.hu - Gamer Caf\u00e9 Kft.", "CrowD Games", "Dragonfly Publishing", "Funforge", "GeGe Co.

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons \u2014 the currency/points in the game \u2014 and someone is chosen as the start player.\n\nOn a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.\n\nIn addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn \"button income\": sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.\n\nWhat's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.\n\nAdditionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)\n\nWhen a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "238617", "name": "Patchwork: 5x5 Bonuskarte"}, {"id": "257570", "name": "Patchwork: Automa"}, {"id": "236608", "name": "Special Buttons (fan expansion for Patchwork)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 44580, "average": 7.65981, "bayesaverage": 7.55454, "stddev": 1.14286, "median": 0.0, "owned": 65273, "trading": 408, "wanting": 784, "wishing": 6096, "numcomments": 5872, "numweights": 1183, "averageweight": 1.645, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 86}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 4}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 9}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 361, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 274}, "2": {"best_rating": 350, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 277}}}, "usersrated": 44580.0, "average": 7.65981, "bayesaverage": 7.55454, "stddev": 1.14286, "median": 0.0, "owned": 65273.0, "trading": 408.0, "wanting": 784.0, "wishing": 6096.0, "numcomments": 5872.0, "numweights": 1183.0, "averageweight": 1.645, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 86}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 4}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 9}], "game_family": "Patchwork", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "139030", "name": "Mascarade", "alternative_names": ["\u00c1larcosb\u00e1l", "Maskarada", "\u5316\u88dd\u821e\u6703"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OS3ckk3rZbwFi8en1rjiGQ__thumb/img/p4r9ENijnNYPOB9L_i4ZkPCCACg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1762410.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OS3ckk3rZbwFi8en1rjiGQ__original/img/659I4dOGhGMkUiGSZs-tpof9OSo=/0x0/pic1762410.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Theme: Witches"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Medieval", "Party Game"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hidden Roles", "Memory", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Bruno Faidutti"], "artists": ["J\u00e9r\u00e9my Masson"], "publishers": ["Repos Production", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Bur\u00f3", "Hobby Japan", "Jolly Thinkers", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "Players in Mascarade start with six coins and a randomly dealt character card.

You don't have to have that character card in front of you to take this action, but if someone else says that they're that character and reveals the card to prove it, that player takes the action instead while you lose one coin to the tribunal.\n\n2) Swap cards or not: Take another player's character card along with yours, place them under the table, shuffle them around a bit, then give one card back to the other player while keeping one for yourself. You (presumably) know whether you changed characters and can have some idea of who you are now, but that other player might be in the dark.\n\n3) Secretly look at your character: Look at your character card to make sure of who you are.\n\nPlay continues until one player obtains 13 coins and wins!\n\nMascarade includes more character cards than the number of players, so not all characters will be used in each game.

This is a re-release of Formula D\u00c3\u00a9 with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -\n\nThe game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a \"stop\" rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. \n Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car\u2019s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car\u2019s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.\n\nHowever, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.\n\nFormula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a \"Dashboard\" with movable pegs to manage your car\u2019s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with \"Character\" profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of \"Fuel\" for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.\n\nThe popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D\u00c3\u00a9 Mini), and a lot of \"after market\" parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "299703", "name": "Circuit de la Sarthe LeMans (fan expansion for Formula D(\u00e9))"}, {"id": "72775", "name":

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.\n\nTheme:\n\nTsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the \"many roads that lead to divine wisdom\", and the game as a whole representing \"the classic quest for enlightenment\".\n\nThis theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.\n\nOther notes:\n\nTsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as \u201cThe Factory\u201d, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.\n\nScythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.\n\nEach player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction\u2019s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).\n\nScythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player\u2019s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \u201cencounter\u201d cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.\n\nScythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.\n\nEvery part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "276229", "name": "Scythe: Bonus Promo Pack \u2013 6 Promo Encounter Cards numbers 37-42"}, {"id": "262151", "name": "Scythe: Encounters"}, {"id": "199727", "name": "Scythe: Invaders from Afar"}, {"id": "279304", "name": "Scythe: Modular Board"}, {"id": "211731", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #1 \u2013 Encounter Cards 29-32"}, {"id": "221033", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #11 \u2013 Encounter Card 39"}, {"id": "232176", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #12 \u2013 Encounter Card 40"}, {"id": "232087", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #13 \u2013 Encounter Card 41"}, {"id": "237663", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #14 \u2013 Encounter Card 42"}, {"id": "205121", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #2 \u2013 Encounter Cards 33-36"}, {"id": "211732", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #3 \u2013 Objective Cards 24-27"}, {"id": "211733", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #4 \u2013 Factory Cards 13-18"}, {"id": "212879", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #6 \u2013 Encounter Card 37"}, {"id": "204984", "name": "Scythe: Promo Pack #7 \u2013 Encounter Card 38"}, {"id": "242277", "name": "Scythe: The Rise of Fenris"}, {"id": "223555", "name": "Scythe: The Wind Gambit"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 115, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 115, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 55556, "average": 8.24265, "bayesaverage": 8.08497, "stddev": 1.43591, "median": 0.0, "owned": 72138, "trading": 473, "wanting": 1954, "wishing": 17045, "numcomments": 8519, "numweights": 2177, "averageweight": 3.4047, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 12}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 12}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 995, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 384, "not_recommended_rating": 210}, "2": {"best_rating": 38, "recommended_rating": 478, "not_recommended_rating": 259}, "3": {"best_rating": 216, "recommended_rating": 516, "not_recommended_rating": 62}, "4": {"best_rating": 600, "recommended_rating": 229, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "5": {"best_rating": 263, "recommended_rating": 406, "not_recommended_rating": 84}, "5+": {"best_rating": 33, "recommended_rating": 173, "not_recommended_rating": 326}}}, "usersrated": 55556.0, "average": 8.24265, "bayesaverage": 8.08497, "stddev": 1.43591, "median": 0.0, "owned": 72138.0, "trading": 473.0, "wanting": 1954.0, "wishing": 17045.0, "numcomments": 8519.0, "numweights": 2177.0, "averageweight": 3.4047, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 12}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 12}], "game_family": "Scythe", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 16, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "234277", "name": "Nusfjord", "alternative_names": ["\u041d\u0443\u0441\u0444\u044c\u043e\u0440\u0434", "\u30cc\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30e8\u30eb\u30c9"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKYqNPEE94Zk_q5Vtk527w__thumb/img/b380XF_C0n--whN9elUn8jI__Yg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3729070.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKYqNPEE94Zk_q5Vtk527w__original/img/-IF49o4vSZVa-o_6kUq5cilr55M=/0x0/pic3729070.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Fish / Fishes", "Country: Norway", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Economic"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Patrick Soeder"], "publishers": ["Lookout Games", "CrowD Games", "Hobby Japan", "Ludofy Creative", "Mayfair Games", "SD Games"], "description": "Nusfjord is a tranquil fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.\n\nIn the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep.\n\nAs with Agricola and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions. Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space \u2014 which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "258645", "name": "Nusfjord: Plaice Deck"}, {"id": "321074", "name": "Nusfjord: Salmon Deck"}, {"id": "309115", "name": "Nusfjord: Solo Challenge"}, {"id": "264404", "name": "Nusfjord: The Forgotten"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 100, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 100, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 3830, "average": 7.60307, "bayesaverage": 6.99372, "stddev": 1.18093, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6109, "trading": 82, "wanting": 567, "wishing": 2236, "numcomments": 818, "numweights": 133, "averageweight": 2.8722, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 385}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 222}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 112, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 44, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "2": {"best_rating": 23, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "3": {"best_rating": 40, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 33}}}, "usersrated": 3830.0, "average": 7.60307, "bayesaverage": 6.99372, "stddev": 1.18093, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6109.0, "trading": 82.0, "wanting": 567.0, "wishing": 2236.0, "numcomments": 818.0, "numweights": 133.0, "averageweight": 2.8722, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 385}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 222}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "234487", "name": "Altiplano", "alternative_names": ["\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e", "\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 \u30a2\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc\u30ce", "\u5357\u7f8e\u9ad8\u539f", "\uc54c\ud2f0\ud50c\ub77c\ub178"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hgUDu_oG0uhnOWX4WM2vXA__thumb/img/KlzN2TK2WVHgCimiLG_aoEZXVQA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4070329.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hgUDu_oG0uhnOWX4WM2vXA__original/img/NeEN85Zbbt-pWxOlK64nrDeoW3Y=/0x0/pic4070329.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Altiplano"], "categories": ["Economic"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Contracts", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Reiner Stockhausen"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz", "Andrea Kattnig", "Jeff Oglesby"], "publishers": ["dlp games", "Angry Lion Games", "Arclight", "Arrakis Games", "Baldar", "GaGa Games", "Giochix.it", "MeepleBR", "Pixie Games", "Reflexshop", "Renegade Game Studios", "Surfin' Meeple China", "White Goblin Games"], "description": "Altiplano is a bag-building game along the lines of Orl\u00e9ans, set in the South American highlands of the Andes (the \"Altiplano\").

Players have limited access to production at the start, but they can acquire additional production sites during the game that open up new options. The various types of goods \u2014 such as fish, alpaca, cacao, silver and corn \u2014 all have their own characteristics and places where they can be used. For example, while silver can be sold for a high price at the market, fish can be exchanged for other goods at the harbor and alpaca can produce wool at the farm that can then be made into cloth.\n\nAside from building up an effective production, players must fulfill their orders at the right time, develop the road in good time and store their goods cleverly enough to fill their warehouses in the most valuable way. Often, a good warehouse keeper is more relevant in the end than the best producer.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "264015", "name": "Altiplano: Alpaca Rider Role Tile"}, {"id": "248378", "name": "Altiplano: Sunny Days"}, {"id": "257047", "name": "Altiplano: The Traveler"}, {"id": "257590", "name": "Deutscher Spielepreis 2018 Goodie Box"}, {"id": "290834", "name": "Level Up Loot 2"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 6618, "average": 7.54731, "bayesaverage": 7.13167, "stddev": 1.26628, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9135, "trading": 169, "wanting": 464, "wishing": 2168, "numcomments": 1143, "numweights": 215, "averageweight": 3.3349, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 281}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 173}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 126, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 47}, "2": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 61, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "3": {"best_rating": 57, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 51, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "5": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 51}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 45}}}, "usersrated": 6618.0, "average": 7.54731, "bayesaverage": 7.13167, "stddev": 1.26628, "median": 0.0, "owned": 9135.0, "trading": 169.0, "wanting": 464.0, "wishing": 2168.0, "numcomments": 1143.0, "numweights": 215.0, "averageweight": 3.3349, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 281}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 173}], "game_family": "Altiplano", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "203993", "name": "Lorenzo il Magnifico", "alternative_names": ["Lorenzo der Pr\u00e4chtige", "Lorenzo le Magnifique", "\u041b\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u043e \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0439", "\u8f1d\u714c\u7684\u7f85\u502b\u4f50", "\uc704\ub300\ud55c \ub85c\ub80c\ucd08"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8G6GkImjt0F_L5aYb8fmtQ__thumb/img/MoUo5LUThQh7CyxGX6QnPBM5zAo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3175535.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8G6GkImjt0F_L5aYb8fmtQ__original/img/yoCGxA_YHrJnlBGRdpOjLFxcnsQ=/0x0/pic3175535.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Cities: Florence (Tuscany, Italy)", "Country: Italy", "Game: Lorenzo il Magnifico", "Mechanism: Tableau Building"], "categories": ["Renaissance"], "implementations": ["Masters of Renaissance: Lorenzo il Magnifico \u2013 The Card Game"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement", "Worker Placement with Dice Workers"], "designers": ["Flaminia Brasini", "Virginio Gigli", "Simone Luciani"], "artists": ["Klemens Franz", "Andrea Kattnig", "Andreas Resch"], "publishers": ["Cranio Creations", "Albi", "Albi Polska", "Angry Lion Games", "Atalia", "CMON Limited", "CrowD Games", "DMZ Games", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "MeepleBR", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)"], "description": "Lorenzo de' Medici, also known as \"Lorenzo il Magnifico\" (Lorenzo the Magnificent), was one of the most powerful and enthusiastic patrons of the Italian Renaissance.\n\nIn Lorenzo il Magnifico, each player takes the role of the head of a noble family in a city during the Italian Renaissance to gain more prestige and fame \u2014 that is, victory points (VP) \u2014 than anyone else.

Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles.  If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose.  Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.\n\nThe expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.

Polo started on a journey to China with his father and older brother. After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the \"Silk Road\", they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.\n\nIn The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character and special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. The five main actions are shown on the bottom part of the board:\n\n\n    Get resources with 1-3 dice, depending on the value of the resource (camels, pepper, silk, gold). The first player for each resource gets them for free; the later ones have to pay according to the value shown on the dice.\n\n\n\n    Take one resource of your choice and two camels. Each player sets the minimum value for the future dice.\n\n\n\n    Earn money, with any one die netting you five money.\n\n\n\n    Purchase orders: The value of one die unlocks the orders up to that number (shown on the spaces) and allows you to buy one or two of those orders. Orders are refreshed and placed at the beginning of each round. To fulfill an order, players have to spend resources for victory points, other resources, camels, and more.\n\n\n\n    Travel: Two dice are placed to unlock the distance that can be traveled on the upper part of the board, that is, the map. Here, the traveler piece of each player starts at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a traveler stops at a city, they place a marker there, giving them access to a different additional action for the rest of the game.\n\n\nAfter five rounds, the game ends with players receiving victory points for arriving in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having reached the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game; these points are added to the VPs gained during the game.\n\nAuf den Spuren von Marco Polo should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which had the same German title.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "232945", "name": "The Voyages of Marco Polo: Agents of Venice"}, {"id": "186554", "name": "The Voyages of Marco Polo: The New Characters"}, {"id": "249086", "name": "The Voyages of Marco Polo: The Secret Path of Marco Polo"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 100, "minplaytime": 40, "maxplaytime": 100, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 19600, "average": 7.88153, "bayesaverage": 7.68204, "stddev": 1.25701, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22019, "trading": 282, "wanting": 1015, "wishing": 4528, "numcomments": 2875, "numweights": 950, "averageweight": 3.1905, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 52}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 48}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 394, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 11, "not_recommended_rating": 188}, "2": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 268, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "3": {"best_rating": 123, "recommended_rating": 193, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 212, "recommended_rating": 101, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 143}}}, "usersrated": 19600.0, "average": 7.88153, "bayesaverage": 7.68204, "stddev": 1.25701, "median": 0.0, "owned": 22019.0, "trading": 282.0, "wanting": 1015.0, "wishing": 4528.0, "numcomments": 2875.0, "numweights": 950.0, "averageweight": 3.1905, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 52}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 48}], "game_family": "The Voyages of Marco Polo", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "171668", "name": "The Grizzled", "alternative_names": ["Los Inseparables", "Les Poilus", "Rem\u00e9ny hadm\u0171velet", "Ta-Pum!", "Veteranii", "Wiarusi", "\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044e", "\u6b65\u5175\u7684\u6050\u60e7", "\ubcd1\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc758 \uadc0\ud5a5"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5JuQCtSAeSZpAL3WgWdwow__thumb/img/XcI-3g0sVumt8DsaMaBGrwftIRw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3719610.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5JuQCtSAeSZpAL3WgWdwow__original/img/7_qWC5F5DdSXCpmADUDUsuW9mNg=/0x0/pic3719610.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: The Grizzled", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play"], "categories": ["Card Game", "World War I"], "implementations": ["The Grizzled: Armistice Edition"], "mechanics": ["Communication Limits", "Cooperative Game", "Hand Management", "Move Through Deck", "Push Your Luck", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Fabien Riffaud", "Juan Rodriguez"], "artists": ["Tignous"], "publishers": ["Sweet Games", "BoardM Factory", "CMON Limited", "Cool Mini Or Not", "Lavka Games", "Lex Games", "Ludonova", "Oliphante", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Reflexshop", "Spaghetti Western Games"], "description": "The Grizzled is a cooperative game about survival in the trenches during the first World War where players win or lose together.\n\nEach round, the current team leader will choose how many cards every player draws.

Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive).

Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.\n\nT.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of \"decksploration\". Each player is free to give their character as deep a \"role\" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a \"run\"; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario\u2019s obstacles.\n\nThe base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which \u2014 Asylum \u2014 is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.\n\nYou usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...\n\nIn the box, an insert allows players to \"save\" the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.\n\nT.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOfficial FAQ\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExpansions were published in this order:\n\nAsylum (base game) (2015)\nT.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)\nT.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) \nT.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) \nT.I.M.E Stories: Expedition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Endurance (2017) \nT.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)\nT.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)\nT.I.M.E Stories: Brotherhood of the Coast (2018)\nT.I.M.E Stories: Madame (2019)\n\nThe Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "287916", "name": "Ancients Part 1 (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "288199", "name": "Ancients Part 2: Lost In Time (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "224784", "name": "Anomaly (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "270352", "name": "Antic (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "303638", "name": "Basilisk's Lair (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "201669", "name": "Batman: Year One (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "230055", "name": "Black Knight (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "191779", "name": "Brettspiel Easter Basket 2016"}, {"id": "305903", "name": "Brick Crime (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "219554", "name": "Broken Peace (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "231848", "name": "A Case of Relativity (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "264440", "name": "La Cavale des Daltons (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories Revolution)"}, {"id": "227838", "name": "Chasing Eden (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "263357", "name": "City of Souls (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "205611", "name": "Deutscher Spielepreis 2016 Goodie Box"}, {"id": "263359", "name": "Dilemma (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "263355", "name": "Dreamland (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "223878", "name": "Easy Street (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "287961", "name": "Fight of the Worlds (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "250470", "name": "Geologists (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "240850", "name": "Golem (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "242894", "name": "Heresy (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)"}, {"id": "262613", "name": "Hora fugit facta manent (fan expansion for T.I.M.E.

Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl. Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!\n\nAn exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.\n\nIn City of the Ancients, players will encounter portals to the otherworld on the Plains of Targa, finding an ancient frozen city whose living inhabitants are nowhere to be found.  Instead, great mechanical keepers wander the city going about their duties - until interrupted by the arrival of the players' characters!\n\nSo load up yer' six shooter, throw on yer' hat and poncho, and gather the posse as the darkness is coming, and all hell's about to break loose...in the Shadows of Brimstone!\n\nCan be used together with Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death to raise the maximum players to 6.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "316261", "name": "Shadows of Brimstone: Ancient Gate"}, {"id": "242276", "name": "Shadows of Brimstone: Ancient Horrors Enemy Pack"}, {"id": "181555", "name": "Shadows of Brimstone: Ancient Terrors Game Supplement"}, {"id": "233593", "name": "Shadows of Brimstone: Auto-Turrets"}, {"id": "233592", "name": "Shadows of Brimstone: B.E.A.C.O.N.

Over time, the players develop their farms and deliver goods to the village.

They will earn VPs by delivering goods to the village of Esporles.  It is important to observe the actions of other players, manipulate turn order, and adjust your strategy based on the dice and cards.\n\nLa Granja is a fascinating game that requires careful planning. Timing and speed is crucial. However, successful players must cope with the uncertainty of events during the game.

The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and \"violet\" buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.\n\nIn each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.\n\nThough similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "165355", "name": "San Juan: The New Buildings & The Events"}, {"id": "40688", "name": "Treasure Chest"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2004, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 22061, "average": 7.25791, "bayesaverage": 7.12185, "stddev": 1.17293, "median": 0.0, "owned": 23871, "trading": 570, "wanting": 453, "wishing": 2399, "numcomments": 5532, "numweights": 2031, "averageweight": 2.288, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 285}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 220}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 331, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 177}, "2": {"best_rating": 90, "recommended_rating": 193, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "3": {"best_rating": 178, "recommended_rating": 107, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4": {"best_rating": 116, "recommended_rating": 141, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 8, "not_recommended_rating": 147}}}, "usersrated": 22061.0, "average": 7.25791, "bayesaverage": 7.12185, "stddev": 1.17293, "median": 0.0, "owned": 23871.0, "trading": 570.0, "wanting": 453.0, "wishing": 2399.0, "numcomments": 5532.0, "numweights": 2031.0, "averageweight": 2.288, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 285}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 220}], "game_family": "Puerto Rico", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "169124", "name": "Flick 'em Up!", "alternative_names": ["Flick 'em Up!: Dzika strzelanka", "Flick 'em Up!: Tierra de Forajidos", "Vigy\u00e1zat, vadnyugat!", "\u8352\u91ce\u5927\u5f48\u5ba2"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uTrqB91Kzvqtb4Ophk1BPw__thumb/img/uYpJnYTjRgevqAtujITGFBdHNU4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5095159.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uTrqB91Kzvqtb4Ophk1BPw__original/img/ycQEZWbJ5amBgH5zp6fDGExno6o=/0x0/pic5095159.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Flick 'em Up", "Mechanism: Finger Flicking Games", "Organizations: Forgenext"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "American West", "Fighting"], "implementations": ["Flick 'em Up!: Dead of Winter", "Flick 'em Up!: Giant Edition"], "mechanics": ["Flicking", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Team-Based Game"], "designers": ["Ga\u00ebtan Beaujannot", "Jean Yves Monpertuis"], "artists": ["Marie-Elaine B\u00e9rub\u00e9", "Philippe Gu\u00e9rin", "Chris Quilliams"], "publishers": ["Pretzel Games", "Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Ghenos Games", "Lacerta", "Ludonova", "One Moment Games", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "The cities in the West are not the safest place to be.

Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!\n\nTo begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.\n\nEach round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.\n\nThe Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!\n\nDuring the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.\n\nIn addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.\n\nTides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A Dance with Dragons (2012)\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A Feast for Crows (2013)\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mother of Dragons (2018)\n\n\n\n\nReimplements:\n\n     A Game of Thrones (2003)\n     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)\n     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "124693", "name": "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Dance with Dragons"}, {"id": "140261", "name": "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Feast for Crows"}, {"id": "257496", "name": "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 Mother of Dragons"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 240, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 240, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 28094, "average": 7.60899, "bayesaverage": 7.4067, "stddev": 1.51789, "median": 0.0, "owned": 37769, "trading": 1014, "wanting": 535, "wishing": 4975, "numcomments": 4146, "numweights": 1502, "averageweight": 3.7157, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 126}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 120}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 870, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 524}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 532}, "3": {"best_rating": 30, "recommended_rating": 185, "not_recommended_rating": 454}, "4": {"best_rating": 34, "recommended_rating": 352, "not_recommended_rating": 301}, "5": {"best_rating": 76, "recommended_rating": 478, "not_recommended_rating": 140}, "6": {"best_rating": 744, "recommended_rating": 72, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "6+": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 307}}}, "usersrated": 28094.0, "average": 7.60899, "bayesaverage": 7.4067, "stddev": 1.51789, "median": 0.0, "owned": 37769.0, "trading": 1014.0, "wanting": 535.0, "wishing": 4975.0, "numcomments": 4146.0, "numweights": 1502.0, "averageweight": 3.7157, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 126}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 120}], "game_family": "A Game of Thrones \u2013 The Board Game", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "81618", "name": "Small World: Be Not Afraid...", "alternative_names": ["Small World: Grandes Esencias", "Small World: Keine Panik!", "Small World: M\u00eame pas peur!", "Small World: Nie b\u00f3j nic", "Small World: Senza Paura...", "Small World: \u6050\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306a\u304b\u308c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XxDZujpe4AR6yBkCHOS2JA__thumb/img/8RmZYOboSYpwfBQ4ELq6TlJq6j0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1134493.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XxDZujpe4AR6yBkCHOS2JA__original/img/uHecXLCzYWAA1vVlgRFou_CI4SI=/0x0/pic1134493.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Small World"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Philippe Keyaerts"], "artists": ["Miguel Coimbra", "Cyrille Daujean"], "publishers": ["Asterion Press", "Days of Wonder", "Edge Entertainment", "Hobby Japan"], "description": "In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.

To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.\n\nOUTLINE OF GAME PLAY\nThe object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or less Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.\n\nGAME CHARACTERISTICS\nThe game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy. It plays differently from 2-4 players, but each game is equally fun and challenging.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2007, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 14757, "average": 7.19629, "bayesaverage": 7.02398, "stddev": 1.18004, "median": 0.0, "owned": 18588, "trading": 393, "wanting": 633, "wishing": 3209, "numcomments": 3595, "numweights": 727, "averageweight": 1.6795, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 361}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 253}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 75}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 327, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 165}, "2": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 169, "not_recommended_rating": 52}, "3": {"best_rating": 170, "recommended_rating": 121, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 115, "recommended_rating": 140, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 130}}}, "usersrated": 14757.0, "average": 7.19629, "bayesaverage": 7.02398, "stddev": 1.18004, "median": 0.0, "owned": 18588.0, "trading": 393.0, "wanting": 633.0, "wishing": 3209.0, "numcomments": 3595.0, "numweights": 727.0, "averageweight": 1.6795, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 361}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 253}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 75}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "34499", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm", "alternative_names": ["(\u9280\u6cb3\u7af6\u9010 \u96c6\u7d50\u98a8\u66b4)", "Galaxia: La tormenta", "Race for the Galaxy: Aufziehender Sturm", "Race for the Galaxy: La Tempesta si Avvicina", "Race for the Galaxy: Temp\u00eate en formation", "\u0411\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0431\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0439", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\uff1a\u5d50\u306e\u4e88\u5146", "\u94f6\u6cb3\u7ade\u9010 \u96c6\u7ed3\u98ce\u66b4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UHK2ry5-IhSr2cv4DP3JkQ__thumb/img/x5hUrvtJ0ttO3JtHHZoXs8ucMj0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic376993.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UHK2ry5-IhSr2cv4DP3JkQ__original/img/sxU7KBOz6bF3861tkeJpyw4XalM=/0x0/pic376993.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Race for the Galaxy", "Players: Expansions Adding Solo Play", "Players: Expansions Changing Player Count", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Civilization", "Economic", "Expansion for Base-game", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Thomas Lehmann"], "artists": ["Martin Hoffmann", "Claus Stephan"], "publishers": ["Rio Grande Games", "ABACUSSPIELE", "Gabinete L\u00fadico", "Gamesinitaly", "Ghenos Games", "Giochix.it", "Hobby Japan", "Hobby World", "Ystari Games"], "description": "The Gathering Storm is the first expansion for Race for the Galaxy and adds new cards, an additional player, goals to compete over, as well as solitaire and drafting rules.

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:\n\n     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.\n     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.\n\n\n\n\nFeaturing more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.\n\nYet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "226840", "name": "Star Wars: Rebellion \u2013 Rise of the Empire"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 240, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 240, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 22226, "average": 8.42025, "bayesaverage": 8.16263, "stddev": 1.38412, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33481, "trading": 248, "wanting": 1446, "wishing": 9959, "numcomments": 3469, "numweights": 756, "averageweight": 3.705, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 8}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 5}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 445, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 298}, "2": {"best_rating": 415, "recommended_rating": 26, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 60, "not_recommended_rating": 262}, "4": {"best_rating": 16, "recommended_rating": 127, "not_recommended_rating": 201}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 270}}}, "usersrated": 22226.0, "average": 8.42025, "bayesaverage": 8.16263, "stddev": 1.38412, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33481.0, "trading": 248.0, "wanting": 1446.0, "wishing": 9959.0, "numcomments": 3469.0, "numweights": 756.0, "averageweight": 3.705, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 8}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 5}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "125153", "name": "The Gallerist", "alternative_names": ["\u85dd\u5eca\u7d93\u7d00\u4eba", "\uac24\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8", "\ub354 \uac24\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ie1GSt1XV04sXQXt-3O1UQ__thumb/img/O0H84AvXp139U865gRLGiAo9-gA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2503200.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ie1GSt1XV04sXQXt-3O1UQ__original/img/Ye9XSo3Ozz93R3ofXYHWfC_pMFg=/0x0/pic2503200.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Giochistarter", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Crowdfunding: Spieleschmiede", "Game: The Gallerist", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Art", "Theme: Painting / Paintings"], "categories": ["Economic"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Commodity Speculation", "Investment", "Set Collection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Vital Lacerda"], "artists": ["Ian O'Toole"], "publishers": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Angry Lion Games", "Fire on Board Jogos", "Giochix.it", "sternenschimmermeer"], "description": "This age of art and capitalism has created a need for a new occupation - The Gallerist.\n\nCombining the elements of an Art dealer, museum curator, and Artists\u2019 manager, you are about to take on that job!

To save on money, you've moved out of your old castle and into a luxurious ravine. You didn't like that castle anyway; it was always getting looted and never at a reasonable hour. And if it wasn't barbarians it was the plague, or sometimes both would come at once, and there wouldn't be enough chairs. The ravine is great; you get lots of sun, and you can just drop garbage wherever you want. In your free time you've taken up begging. Begging is brilliant conceptually, but tricky in practice since no one has any money. You beg twigs from the villagers, and they beg them back, but no one really seems to come out ahead. That's just how life is sometimes. You're quietly conquering people, minding your own business, when suddenly there's a plague, or barbarians, or everyone's illiterate, and it's all you can do to cling to some wreckage as the storm passes through. Still, you are sure that, as always, you will triumph over this adversity, or at least do slightly better than everyone else.\n\nDominion: Dark Ages is the seventh addition to the game of Dominion. It contains 500 cards but is not a standalone game. It adds 35 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus new bad cards you give to other players (Ruins), new cards to replace starting Estates (Shelters), and cards you can get only via specific other cards.

But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.

Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors.

Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, Red Skull in the base game), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks \u2013 Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc. \u2013 and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.\n\nOver the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains \"master strike\" cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.\n\nAs players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however \u2013 having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes \u2013 then the players all lose.\n\nHero decks in the base game: Gambit, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Emma Frost, Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Storm, Captain America, Nick Fury, Rogue, Cyclops, Hulk, Wolverine, Deadpool\n\n",

(A player can never claim more cubes than the number of remaining rounds).\n\nPlayers rotate their ship's wheels each round, then use the cubes available to them in that round to perform various actions: activating cards selected in that round or earlier rounds, buying city quarters and collecting the goods located there, moving that player's ship around Europe to deliver those goods, acquiring gold coins, taking special actions with card previously activated, and advancing on a turn order track.\n\nPlayers score points by delivering goods, paying gold coins, using the powers on their cards, and building in Macao. Whoever has the most points at the end of twelve rounds wins.\n\nMacao is number 13 in the alea big box series, with an estimated difficulty on the alea scale of 6/10.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2009, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 100, "minplaytime": 50, "maxplaytime": 100, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 6899, "average": 7.42869, "bayesaverage": 7.08201, "stddev": 1.33424, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6518, "trading": 102, "wanting": 855, "wishing": 2341, "numcomments": 1720, "numweights": 527, "averageweight": 3.1366, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 317}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 198}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 147, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 60}, "2": {"best_rating": 31, "recommended_rating": 80, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "3": {"best_rating": 67, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 40, "recommended_rating": 55, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 54}}}, "usersrated": 6899.0, "average": 7.42869, "bayesaverage": 7.08201, "stddev": 1.33424, "median": 0.0, "owned": 6518.0, "trading": 102.0, "wanting": 855.0, "wishing": 2341.0, "numcomments": 1720.0, "numweights": 527.0, "averageweight": 3.1366, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 317}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 198}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "55690", "name": "Kingdom Death: Monster", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LenzJBOHboAGU0cUIqAZPQ__thumb/img/Z3yFJIp9rmSmcGoTiqGeTkKCnQU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2931007.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LenzJBOHboAGU0cUIqAZPQ__original/img/AtA42fNGhdthAAP3Y5QZiwlFcv8=/0x0/pic2931007.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Miniatures", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Kingdom Death Monster", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Mature / Adult", "Miniatures", "Mythology"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Role Playing", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Storytelling"], "designers": ["Adam Poots"], "artists": ["Zeen Chin", "Lokman Lam", "Lorinda Tomko"], "publishers": ["Kingdom Death"], "description": "Kingdom Death: Monster is a fully cooperative tabletop hobby game experience.  Set in a unique nightmarish world devoid of most natural resources, you control a settlement at the dawn of its existence. Fight monsters, craft weapons and gear, and develop your settlement to ensure your survival from generation to generation.\n\nCampaign System\nEmbark alone or with up to 3 friends (5 with game variant) on a 5-30-lantern-year campaign, with each year consisting of a cycle of hunt, showdown, and settlement phases. The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival.  During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a \"choose your own adventure\" style journey through various events and encounters.  Finally, when you meet the monster you're pursuing, you'll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive.  If your party lives, you'll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement.\n\nMonster AI System\nEach of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it's HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.\n\nGear System\nIn Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly.\n\nStory Event System\n40+ Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign. Story Events detail important evolutions in your civilization, introduce new monsters, and provide rich detail for your campaign.  Some will trigger automatically as you progress through the campaign, but most will be entirely based on choices players make.\n\nStory Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to key events that happen within the overall story. Some are triggered directly from the timeline and others from choices you make in game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "291481", "name": "Kingdom Death: Monster \u2013 10th Anniversary Survivors"},

As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it's up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.\n\nPlayers roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities \u2014 and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.\n\nAt the end of each turn, new \"infection dice\" are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations.

Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.\n\nTo conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.\n\nSekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:\n\n        No dice are used\n        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.\n        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.\n        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.\n\n\n\n\nSekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.\n\nSekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.\n\nNo dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nLegitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.\n\nThe initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.\n\nBlocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.\n\nTrue to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.\n\nEach player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.\n\nTIME SCALE     1 week per 2-player turns\nMAP SCALE     Point to point\nUNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS     2\n\nCOMPONENTS\n    Mounted Map\n    119 wooden pieces\n    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets\n    110 cards\n    Rulebook\n    Two player aid cards\n\nDESIGNER: Matthew Calkins\nMAP, CARD, & BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey\n\n(source: GMT website)\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 4244, "average": 8.04636, "bayesaverage": 7.35158, "stddev": 1.26576, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7294, "trading": 120, "wanting": 595, "wishing": 2588, "numcomments": 1193, "numweights": 303, "averageweight": 2.7624, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 157}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 5}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 53, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "2": {"best_rating": 52, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 38}}}, "usersrated": 4244.0, "average": 8.04636, "bayesaverage": 7.35158, "stddev": 1.26576, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7294.0, "trading": 120.0, "wanting": 595.0, "wishing": 2588.0, "numcomments": 1193.0, "numweights": 303.0, "averageweight": 2.7624, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 157}, {"id": "4664", "name": "wargames", "friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "value": 5}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "25292", "name": "Merchants & Marauders", "alternative_names": ["Corsari dei Caraibi", "Fortunes de Mer", "Korsaren der Karibik", "Kupcy i Korsarze", "Merchants and Marauders", "Piraten & Kooplui", "\u5546\u4eba\u8207\u63a0\u596a\u8005"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__thumb/img/Rd6POAEmJOEtwKB7bSDTKPsL_9k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic738119.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__original/img/mNWaseFj2eSJP6VdhsIs9GdeYSs=/0x0/pic738119.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Region: Caribbean Sea", "Theme: Colonial", "Theme: Tropical"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fighting", "Nautical", "Pirates", "Transportation"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Race", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Kasper Aagaard", "Christian Marcussen"], "artists": ["Ben Nelson", "Chris Quilliams"], "publishers": ["Z-Man Games, Inc.", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Conclave Editora", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Pegasus Spiele", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "White Goblin Games"], "description": "Merchants & Marauders lets you live the life of an influential merchant or a dreaded pirate in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering.  Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?\n\nIn Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 \"glory\" points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.\n\nA big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn \"pirate\" or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "161167", "name": "Merchants & Marauders: Seas of Glory"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 180, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 12558, "average": 7.41877, "bayesaverage": 7.16543, "stddev": 1.47556, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17217, "trading": 386, "wanting": 965, "wishing": 4891, "numcomments": 2842, "numweights": 806, "averageweight": 3.2395, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 255}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 72}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 296, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 129}, "2": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 151, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "3": {"best_rating": 107, "recommended_rating": 126, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4": {"best_rating": 163, "recommended_rating": 74, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 122}}}, "usersrated": 12558.0, "average": 7.41877, "bayesaverage": 7.16543, "stddev": 1.47556, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17217.0, "trading": 386.0, "wanting": 965.0, "wishing": 4891.0, "numcomments": 2842.0, "numweights": 806.0, "averageweight": 3.2395, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 255}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 72}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "21059", "name": "Arkham Horror: Dunwich Horror Expansion", "alternative_names": ["Arkham Horror: Das Grauen von Dunwich Erweiterung", "Arkham Horror: Dunwich Horror roz\u0161\u00ed\u0159en\u00ed", "Arkham Horror: El Horror de Dunwich Expansi\u00f3n", "Arkham Horror: Grauen von Dunwich Erweiterung", "Arkham Horror: L' Orrore di Dunwich", "Horreur \u00e0 Arkham: L'horreur de Dunwich Extension", "Horror w Arkham: Koszmar z Dunwich Rozszerzenie", "\u0423\u0436\u0430\u0441 \u0410\u0440\u043a\u0445\u044d\u043c\u0430: \u0423\u0436\u0430\u0441 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430", "\u9b54\u93ae\u9a5a\u9b42\uff1a\u6566\u5a01\u6cbb\u6751\u7684\u6050\u6016\u64f4\u5145"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SD4sueZ3S8iL1RlZIq-u_A__thumb/img/RpKj-u4cqnpskpB_QEEpwdEEUA0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic114495.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SD4sueZ3S8iL1RlZIq-u_A__original/img/g2Kvec22j5amcTgFWR59N-Q6Wz4=/0x0/pic114495.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Arkham Horror", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Arkham Horror Files (Fantasy Flight Games)", "Theme: Cthulhu Mythos"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Horror", "Novel-based", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Richard Launius", "Kevin Wilson"], "artists": ["Henning Ludvigsen", "Kurt Miller", "Scott Nicely"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "Nexus Editrice", "Ubik", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "description": "Dunwich Horror is a large-box expansion for the Fantasy Flight Games edition of Arkham Horror, and is a part of the Arkham Horror Series.\n\nOnce again, terror has come to New England, this time spreading to the small country town of Dunwich, just a few miles from Arkham. The area is filled with rolling hills, many of which are topped with mysterious stone circles or the ramshackle houses of the recluses who live outside of town. At night, the piping of the whippoorwills fills the air, while lightning bugs dance in the witch-haunted hallows. This is a place where dark pacts with unknown forces are made, and where city folk go to disappear without a trace.

It also adds new location cards, for a total of 14 cards at each location instead of 7.  Dunwich Horror also adds many new mechanics. Players can take a train to Dunwich (a new board that is placed on the end of the Arkham board), which adds 9 new locations and 2 new outer worlds to the game.

And, of course, the Dunwich Horror itself - not as strong as the Ancient Ones, yet far stronger than any other monster in the game.\n\nThis expansion also features revised rules and an FAQ that addresses many of the perceived faults of the base game.

The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!\n\nThe Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence.

These will be the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder\u201d respectively.\n\nThe Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and the \u201cMeans of Murder\u201d.\n\nInvestigators x8\nTo solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder,\u201d the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).\n\nBear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.\n\nAccomplice x1\nThe Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.\n\nWitness x1\nThe Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.\n\nIf the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "234719", "name": "Deception/CS-Files Theme Pack: North

Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.\n\n\"By design, the game is not overly complex\", says Memoir '44 designer, Richard Borg. \"The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.\" In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir '44 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice.\n\nMemoir '44 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. And with Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.\n\nThe Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of

This complete cooperative strategy card game pits 1 to 4 heroes against the traps, monsters, deadly magic, and despicable foes of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game's award-winning Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path. In this game players take the part of a fantasy character such as a rogue or wizard, each with varying skills and proficiencies that are represented by the cards in their deck. The classic ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) are assigned with different sized dice. Players can acquire allies, spells, weapons, and other items. The goal is to find and defeat a villain before a certain number of turns pass, with the villain being represented by its own deck of cards complete with challenges and foes that must be overcome. Characters grow stronger after each game, adding unique gear and awesome magic to their decks, and gaining incredible powers, all of which they'll need to challenge greater threats in a complete Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Adventure Path.\n\nThe Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is an expandable game, with the first set containing nearly 500 cards. The Rise of the Runelords - Base Set supports 1 to 4 players; a 110-card Character Add-On Deck expands the possible number of players to 5 or 6 and adds more character options for any number of players. The game will be expanded with bimonthly 110-card adventure decks.\n\nErrata: Early printings had the Loot card \"Sihedron Medallion\" listed as belonging to \"B\"  (for Base Set).

Score points for collecting the most sushi rolls or making a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! And once you've eaten it all, finish your meal with all the pudding you've got! But be careful which sushi you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you!\n\nSushi Go! takes the card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of \"draft and pass\" are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "186885", "name": "Stadt Land Spielt Limitierte

Each space captured by a player will add another card to the capturing player's deck.\n\nFrom the box description:\n\nA war fought at the edge of two mighty empires. For over one hundred and fifty years Britain and France were locked in a struggle for domination of North America. Thousands of miles from their homes, settlers and soldiers were faced with impenetrable forests, unpredictable American tribes, and formidable distances. Despite these obstacles they were able to engage in bitter warfare, with the British ultimately taking the prize of Quebec. A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player game that allows you to recreate this contest.

In 2015, astronomers estimated a large distant planet could explain the unique orbits of dwarf planets and other objects. Since then, astronomers have been scanning the sky, hoping to find this planet.\n\nIn The Search for Planet X, players take on the role of astronomers who use observations and logical deductions to search for this hypothetical planet. Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules.\n\nEach round, as the earth travels around the sun, players use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories, which is how players score points.\n\nAs more and more objects are found, players narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points.\n\nThe Search for Planet X captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzle-y nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process. Can you be the first to find Planet X?\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2020, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 771, "average": 8.22198, "bayesaverage": 6.38579, "stddev": 1.21104, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1771, "trading": 7, "wanting": 361, "wishing": 2112, "numcomments": 213, "numweights": 27, "averageweight": 2.5185, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1216}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 554}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 31, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 16, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2": {"best_rating": 17, "recommended_rating": 12, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 24, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 18}}}, "usersrated": 771.0, "average": 8.22198, "bayesaverage": 6.38579, "stddev": 1.21104, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1771.0, "trading": 7.0, "wanting": 361.0, "wishing": 2112.0, "numcomments": 213.0, "numweights": 27.0, "averageweight": 2.5185, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1216}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 554}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "66589", "name": "Navegador", "alternative_names": ["Casa da India"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rdZb15WqByPZzdTKEvNz0Q__thumb/img/H49jq0-D4ceSoqO2c3ZGiNfkOH8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3246725.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rdZb15WqByPZzdTKEvNz0Q__original/img/mS2CkGdFkp6sJAdZaA10PYo_QAc=/0x0/pic3246725.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Portugal", "Game: Navegador", "History: Age of Discovery", "Series: Rondel (Mac Gerdts)", "Theme: Colonial"], "categories": ["Economic", "Exploration", "Nautical", "Renaissance"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Advantage Token", "Area Movement", "Rondel"], "designers": ["Mac Gerdts"], "artists": ["Marina Fahrenbach", "Mac Gerdts"], "publishers": ["PD-Verlag", "Cranio Creations", "Ediciones MasQueOca", "The Game Master BV", "Rio Grande Games", "Ystari Games"], "description": "This game is inspired by the Portuguese Age of Discoveries in the 15th-16th century.

The scientists can use fire, can move by jeep on the tracks, and can even call for reinforcements, while the mamma raptor can hide in the bushes, yell to frighten the scientists, and call for her babies.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2015, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 9, "stats": {"usersrated": 7620, "average": 7.33929, "bayesaverage": 7.01768, "stddev": 1.18471, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11544, "trading": 222, "wanting": 593, "wishing": 3457, "numcomments": 1324, "numweights": 181, "averageweight": 2.0663, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 368}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 246}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 66}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 67, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 59}, "2": {"best_rating": 65, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 55}}}, "usersrated": 7620.0, "average": 7.33929, "bayesaverage": 7.01768, "stddev": 1.18471, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11544.0, "trading": 222.0, "wanting": 593.0, "wishing": 3457.0, "numcomments": 1324.0, "numweights": 181.0, "averageweight": 2.0663, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 368}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 246}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 66}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "177736", "name": "A Feast for Odin", "alternative_names": ["\u00c0 la gloire d'Odin", "Um Banquete a Odin", "El Banquete de Od\u00edn", "Ein Fest f\u00fcr Odin", "La Festa per Odino", "Odin", "Uczta Dla Odyna", "Uczta u Odyna", "\u0412\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0443 \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u795d\u796d", "\u5967\u4e01\u7684\u76db\u5bb4", "\uc624\ub518\uc744 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__thumb/img/AKxMMz2DTbBrEynhDROla8fdjJ4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3146943.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__original/img/h0P5NRuVBu0GuDrJo7CHAiSJo3U=/0x0/pic3146943.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Components: Polyominoes", "Country: Iceland", "Game: A Feast for Odin", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Mythology: Norse", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg)", "Theme: Food / Cooking", "Theme: Vikings"], "categories": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Medieval", "Puzzle"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Automatic Resource Growth", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Coverage", "Income", "Push Your Luck", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tile Placement", "Turn Order: Pass Order", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Dennis Lohausen"], "publishers": ["Feuerland Spiele", "Cranio Creations", "Devir", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Game Harbor", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lacerta", "Mandala Jogos", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)", "White Goblin Games", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game. You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today \u2014 a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.\n\nWhen the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.\nIn what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.\n\nIn this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "232298", "name": "Deutscher Spielepreis 2017 Goodie Box"}, {"id": "236902", "name": "A Feast for Odin: Lofoten, Orkney, and Tierra del Fuego"}, {"id": "292592", "name": "A Feast for Odin: Mini Expansion #2"}, {"id": "240522", "name": "A Feast for Odin: New Special Tiles"}, {"id": "216788", "name": "A Feast for Odin: The Norwegians"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 16579, "average": 8.18896, "bayesaverage": 7.91953, "stddev": 1.35951, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21634, "trading": 170, "wanting": 1800, "wishing": 9284, "numcomments": 2650, "numweights": 600, "averageweight": 3.8383, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 22}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 17}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 374, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 77, "recommended_rating": 182, "not_recommended_rating": 30}, "2": {"best_rating": 142, "recommended_rating": 170, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "3": {"best_rating": 149, "recommended_rating": 124, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "4": {"best_rating": 49, "recommended_rating": 142, "not_recommended_rating": 64}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 167}}}, "usersrated": 16579.0, "average": 8.18896, "bayesaverage": 7.91953, "stddev": 1.35951, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21634.0, "trading": 170.0, "wanting": 1800.0, "wishing": 9284.0, "numcomments": 2650.0, "numweights": 600.0, "averageweight": 3.8383, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 22}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 17}], "game_family": "A Feast for Odin", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "97786", "name": "Small World Underground", "alternative_names": ["Small World: Podziemia", "Small World: \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440", "\u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9", "\u5c0f\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c: \u5730\u5e95\u4e16\u754c"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qFmyurPNiCM8UPtP38mQpg__thumb/img/wLG6hiX2QNkrZCG5bnZqLJB6Pio=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic979889.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qFmyurPNiCM8UPtP38mQpg__original/img/9jl0O3deXF0CPP-cnLfyhmw5zns=/0x0/pic979889.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Small World"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Fighting", "Territory Building"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "King of the Hill", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Philippe Keyaerts"], "artists": ["Miguel Coimbra"], "publishers": ["Days of Wonder", "Edge Entertainment", "Giochi Uniti", "Hobby Japan", "Hobby World", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "\"This world's not big enough for all of us, so it's time you step aside to make room for me.\"\n\nThat's the spirit of Philippe Keyaerts' award-winning Small World, and the 2011 release Small World Underground is a standalone game that keeps that spirit intact, while putting a new spin on the game play.\n\nSmall World Underground includes 15 fantasy-themed races of creatures along with 21 special powers.

How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance \u2013 oh, and win the game.\n\nIn Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.\n\nEach player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:\n\n\n    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.\n    Draw a card from any regular deck \u2013 This can be chosen only once by each player.\n    Visit the opera and spend $2.\n    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.\n    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.\n\n\nPlayers then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses \u2013 of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! \u2013 to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.\n\nAt the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.\n\nIf a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "143063", "name": "Last Will: Getting Sacked"}, {"id": "132436", "name": "Last Will: Messenger Promo Card"}, {"id": "111171", "name": "Last Will: Plan Order Board"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 75, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 75, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 8937, "average": 7.19457, "bayesaverage": 6.94572, "stddev": 1.17144, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10303, "trading": 329, "wanting": 542, "wishing": 2385, "numcomments": 1802, "numweights": 439, "averageweight": 2.7084, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 429}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 277}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 103, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "2": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "3": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 46, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 49, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 11, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 36}}}, "usersrated": 8937.0, "average": 7.19457, "bayesaverage": 6.94572, "stddev": 1.17144, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10303.0, "trading": 329.0, "wanting": 542.0, "wishing": 2385.0, "numcomments": 1802.0, "numweights": 439.0, "averageweight": 2.7084, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 429}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 277}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 3, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "232832", "name": "Century: Golem Edition", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1bihoShOuqaCuZJXB3Q2gQ__thumb/img/dvGQkdnwtcwAmcxHR_7J17OsLjQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3936124.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1bihoShOuqaCuZJXB3Q2gQ__original/img/XZ0Q6Uxrkjrpa9UKSlV6ipWI7cg=/0x0/pic3936124.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Century (Plan B Games)"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Economic", "Fantasy"], "implementations": ["Century: Spice Road"], "mechanics": ["Action Retrieval", "Card Drafting", "Contracts", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Emerson Matsuuchi"], "artists": ["Justin Chan", "Chris Quilliams", "Fernanda Su\u00e1rez"], "publishers": ["Plan B Games", "Cube Factory of Ideas"], "description": "Century: Golem Edition is a re-themed version of Century: Spice Road set in the world of Caravania.

With just one objective to guide them from the very beginning, each player must explore the hidden map, fight ferocious enemies, and build the skills of their survivor as they attempt to complete challenging quests and balance feuding factions within the game.\n\nAs they advance their survivors' stories, players come across new quests and individual targets, leading them to gain influence. Who comes out ahead depends on how keenly and aggressively each player ventures through the game; however, if a single faction is pushed to power too quickly, the wasteland will be taken for their own, and the survivors conquered along with it.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "302643", "name": "Fallout: Atomic Bonds"}, {"id": "256481", "name": "Fallout: New California"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 180, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 180, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 5182, "average": 6.94342, "bayesaverage": 6.4901, "stddev": 1.64073, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11215, "trading": 304, "wanting": 218, "wishing": 2109, "numcomments": 1066, "numweights": 175, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1027}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 274}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 166, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 78, "recommended_rating": 48, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "2": {"best_rating": 55, "recommended_rating": 69, "not_recommended_rating": 19}, "3": {"best_rating": 22, "recommended_rating": 61, "not_recommended_rating": 40}, "4": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 77}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 88}}}, "usersrated": 5182.0, "average": 6.94342, "bayesaverage": 6.4901, "stddev": 1.64073, "median": 0.0, "owned": 11215.0, "trading": 304.0, "wanting": 218.0, "wishing": 2109.0, "numcomments": 1066.0, "numweights": 175.0, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1027}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 274}], "game_family": "Fallout", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "1", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "249259", "name": "War Chest", "alternative_names": ["Champ d'Honneur", "\u0421\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043a \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b", "\uc6cc\uccb4\uc2a4\ud2b8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BryJNSSDbCohXeaJPx3tpw__thumb/img/5fmJlAM307xX3zozMnStTuWYphI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4232048.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BryJNSSDbCohXeaJPx3tpw__original/img/dlBHISK51OXotA6diVGsYycjVqY=/0x0/pic4232048.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Medieval", "Wargame"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Trevor Benjamin", "David Thompson (I)"], "artists": ["Brigette Indelicato"], "publishers": ["Alderac Entertainment Group", "Abraxas", "CrowD Games", "Ghenos Games", "Gigamic", "YOKA Games"], "description": "War Chest is an all-new bag-building war game!

age.\n\nAs in other Carcassonne games, players take turns placing tiles to create the landscape and placing meeples to score points from the map they're creating. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nInstead of cities, roads, and farms, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers has forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows. Players' meeples can represent hunters (when placed in the meadows), gatherers (in a forest), or fishermen (on a river segment). They also have huts, which can be placed on rivers or lakes to get fish from the entire river system.\n\nIt includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new rules, including:\n- A player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to immediately draw and place 1 of 12 bonus (menhir) tiles.\n- A meadow is worth 2 points for every animal in it, except tigers, which negate certain other animals.\n- A river segment is worth the number of tiles in the segment plus the number of fish in the lakes at each end.\n- A fishing hut scores at the end of the game and is worth the number of fish in all the lakes connected by rivers.\n\nThe Devir edition includes (the relevant part of) the Carcassonne: King & Scout expansion\n\nIn the 2020 edition \n- Some of The Scout special tiles are transformed into menhir tiles of which there are more now.\n- A deer scores 1 point, an aurochs 2 points and a mammoth 3 points on meadows. \n- Rivers score for fish in the river segments as well, not only the fish in the lakes at each end.

The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.\n\nThe game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.\n\nThe core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.\n\nImprovements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.\n\nThe \"Chronicles\" in the title \u2014 a set of eight expansions to the base game \u2014 are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The \"Highland Boat Race\" Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The \"Hammer of the Scots\" Chronicle adds a neutral \"Englishman\" playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn \u2014 if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a \"monster game\".\n\nAnother major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new \"person\" tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "326956", "name": "Glen More II: Chronicles \u2013 Feed the Kraken Mini Chronicle"}, {"id": "292921", "name": "Glen More II: Chronicles \u2013 Promo 2"}, {"id": "292621", "name": "Glen More II: Chronicles \u2013 What Lurks Beneath"}, {"id": "313646", "name": "Glen More II: Highland Games"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 3072, "average": 8.04041, "bayesaverage": 7.1781, "stddev": 1.13979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 5966, "trading": 40, "wanting": 512, "wishing": 2154, "numcomments": 633, "numweights": 119, "averageweight": 3.042, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 244}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 124}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 59, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 26}, "2": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 30, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "3": {"best_rating": 32, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "4": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 26, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 26}}}, "usersrated": 3072.0, "average": 8.04041, "bayesaverage": 7.1781, "stddev": 1.13979, "median": 0.0, "owned": 5966.0, "trading": 40.0, "wanting": 512.0, "wishing": 2154.0, "numcomments": 633.0, "numweights": 119.0, "averageweight": 3.042, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 244}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 124}], "game_family": "Glen More", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": true, "susd": false}, {"id": "246192", "name": "Gizmos", "alternative_names": ["K\u00fcty\u00fck", "\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0430\u0441\u044b", "\u7206\u73e0\u767c\u660e", "\uae30\uc988\ubaa8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zin82Hg4MXck86t8fzbsdA__thumb/img/e-UqOrMfsLCh2T_igK3wkoFrOu8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4169718.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zin82Hg4MXck86t8fzbsdA__original/img/YZfE6kSkvOqg6UtSKxly20dH3n8=/0x0/pic4169718.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Components: Marbles", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Misc: Mensa Select"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Contracts"], "designers": ["Phil Walker-Harding"], "artists": ["Hannah Cardoso", "J\u00falia Ferrari", "Giovanna BC Guimar\u00e3es", "Mathieu Harlaut", "Saeed Jalabi"], "publishers": ["CMON Limited", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "Board Game VN", "BoardM Factory", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "GaGa Games", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Lex Games", "Portal Games"], "description": "The smartest minds of our generation are gathering together at the Great Science Fair.

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\n\nThe players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n\nFortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.\n\nUsing those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "130655", "name": "Viticulture: Arboriculture Expansion"}, {"id": "140045", "name": "Viticulture: Kickstarter Promotional Cards"}, {"id": "193823", "name": "Viticulture: Moor Visitors Expansion"}, {"id": "202174", "name": "Viticulture: Tuscany Essential Edition"}, {"id": "147101", "name": "Viticulture: Tuscany \u2013 Expand the World of Viticulture"}, {"id": "248929", "name": "Viticulture: Visit from the Rhine Valley"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 9953, "average": 7.59651, "bayesaverage": 7.29256, "stddev": 1.41843, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8730, "trading": 89, "wanting": 533, "wishing": 2797, "numcomments": 1566, "numweights": 418, "averageweight": 2.933, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 184}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 125}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 128, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 42}, "2": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 62, "not_recommended_rating": 17}, "3": {"best_rating": 56, "recommended_rating": 41, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 59, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "5": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "6": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 43}, "6+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 53}}}, "usersrated": 9953.0, "average": 7.59651, "bayesaverage": 7.29256, "stddev": 1.41843, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8730.0, "trading": 89.0, "wanting": 533.0, "wishing": 2797.0, "numcomments": 1566.0, "numweights": 418.0, "averageweight": 2.933, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 184}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 125}], "game_family": "Viticulture", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "128882", "name": "The Resistance: Avalon", "alternative_names": ["Avalon", "Avalon \u0e2d\u0e27\u0e32\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19", "Avalon: Rycerze Kr\u00f3la Artura", "La Resistencia: \u00c1valon", "Der Widerstand: Avalon", "\u0391\u0392\u0391\u039b\u039f\u039d", "\u30ec\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30b9: \u30a2\u30f4\u30a1\u30ed\u30f3", "\u62b5\u6297\u7d44\u7e54\uff1a\u963f\u74e6\u9686", "\ub808\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud0d5\uc2a4 \uc544\ubc1c\ub860"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LPa6rsGcv8S0-OeNjCOAEQ__thumb/img/RKui79VjUbQAzTWaPu44ytupzDs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1398895.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LPa6rsGcv8S0-OeNjCOAEQ__original/img/kFDTpCfe476T1bzZUtNAbGyIjNg=/0x0/pic1398895.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Werewolf / Mafia", "Series: Postcard Box Games (Indie Boards and Cards)", "Theme: King Arthur / The Knights of the Round Table / Camelot"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction", "Fantasy", "Medieval", "Negotiation", "Party Game", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "implementations": ["Quest: Avalon Big Box Edition", "The Resistance: Hidden Agenda", "The Resistance: Hidden Agenda & Hostile Intent", "The Resistance"], "mechanics": ["Hidden Roles", "Roles with Asymmetric Information", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Team-Based Game", "Traitor Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "designers": ["Don Eskridge"], "artists": ["Luis Francisco", "George Patsouras", "Nan Sumana", "Rafa\u0142 Szyma"], "publishers": ["Indie Boards & Cards", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Devir", "Edge Entertainment", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby Japan", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lanlalen", "Portal Games", "Raven Distribution", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "description": "The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.\n\nThe game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.\n\nThe game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.\n\nThe game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.\n\nThe player with the most victory points wins.\n\nThe rules include basic and advanced versions.\n\nThis game is #14 in the Alea big box series.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "231506", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017"}, {"id": "256951", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018"}, {"id": "264104", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 10th Expansion \u2013 Solo"}, {"id": "110926", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 1st Expansion \u2013 New Player Boards"}, {"id": "132477", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 2nd Expansion \u2013 New Hex Tiles"}, {"id": "139160", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 3rd Expansion \u2013 German Board Game Championship Board 2013"}, {"id": "150083", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 4th Expansion \u2013 Monastery Boards"}, {"id": "166589", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 5th Expansion \u2013 Pleasure Garden"}, {"id": "190225", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 6th Expansion \u2013 The Cloisters"}, {"id": "193585", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 7th Expansion \u2013 German Board Game Championship Board 2016"}, {"id": "214005", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 8th Expansion \u2013 Trade Routes"}, {"id": "234163", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 9th Expansion \u2013 The Team Game"}, {"id": "179205", "name": "Stadt Land Spielt Limitierter Sonderdruck Tag des Gesellschaftsspiels"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 45243, "average": 8.13118, "bayesaverage": 8.01309, "stddev": 1.23719, "median": 0.0, "owned": 61461, "trading": 709, "wanting": 1103, "wishing": 9221, "numcomments": 7644, "numweights": 2343, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 14}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 13}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1145, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 42, "not_recommended_rating": 557}, "2": {"best_rating": 739, "recommended_rating": 302, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "3": {"best_rating": 340, "recommended_rating": 584, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "4": {"best_rating": 199, "recommended_rating": 475, "not_recommended_rating": 240}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 503}}}, "usersrated": 45243.0, "average": 8.13118, "bayesaverage": 8.01309, "stddev": 1.23719, "median": 0.0, "owned": 61461.0, "trading": 709.0, "wanting": 1103.0, "wishing": 9221.0, "numcomments": 7644.0, "numweights": 2343.0, "averageweight": 3.0, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 14}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 13}], "game_family": "The Castles of Burgundy", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "194594", "name": "Dice Forge", "alternative_names": ["Dice Forge: A sors kov\u00e1csai", "Kowale Losu", "\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u044b", "\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b8", "\u935b\u9ab0\u7269\u8a9e"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4BTVGQWO0M9ayxyku3FW6Q__thumb/img/BWNtptZ90Cutx39I3Celuvirt78=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3477004.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4BTVGQWO0M9ayxyku3FW6Q__original/img/2RZLNEGrkZxF9Napw_dnqEbbnl4=/0x0/pic3477004.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Dice with Icons", "Game: Dice Forge"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Mythology"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Random Production"], "designers": ["R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e"], "artists": ["Biboun"], "publishers": ["Libellud", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hobby Japan", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "Heroes, stand ready!

Score the most victory points to win the game!\n\nMystic Vale uses the innovative \"Card Crafting System\", which lets you not only build your deck, but build the individual cards in your deck, customizing each card's abilities to exactly the strategy you want to follow.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "265229", "name": "Mystic Vale Event Kit: Havens"}, {"id": "230815", "name": "Mystic Vale Event Kit: Spirits of the Vale"}, {"id": "242301", "name": "Mystic Vale: Conclave"}, {"id": "219102", "name": "Mystic Vale: Das Tal der Magie & Das Tal der Wildnis"}, {"id": "322161", "name": "Mystic Vale: Evergreen"}, {"id": "214329", "name": "Mystic Vale: Fields of Bounty"}, {"id": "266554", "name": "Mystic Vale: Harmony"}, {"id": "229980", "name": "Mystic Vale: Mana Storm"}, {"id": "292488", "name": "Mystic Vale: Nemesis"}, {"id": "228873", "name": "Mystic Vale: Shard Eater"}, {"id": "232946", "name": "Mystic Vale: Sunshard Glebe"}, {"id": "249514", "name": "Mystic Vale: Twilight Garden"}, {"id": "207591", "name": "Mystic Vale: Vale of Magic"}, {"id": "220502", "name": "Mystic Vale: Vale of the Wild"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 8675, "average": 7.30001, "bayesaverage": 7.00189, "stddev": 1.32121, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12927, "trading": 292, "wanting": 317, "wishing": 2132, "numcomments": 1645, "numweights": 126, "averageweight": 2.2619, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 378}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 258}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 89, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 49}, "2": {"best_rating": 54, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 22, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 35, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 46}}}, "usersrated": 8675.0, "average": 7.30001, "bayesaverage": 7.00189, "stddev": 1.32121, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12927.0, "trading": 292.0, "wanting": 317.0, "wishing": 2132.0, "numcomments": 1645.0, "numweights": 126.0, "averageweight": 2.2619, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 378}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 258}], "game_family": "Mystic Vale", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "194655", "name": "Santorini", "alternative_names": ["\uc0b0\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub2c8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/665Ply7Ho1WVf1v1iZlWeg__thumb/img/BKnSb6kAhpVFHV8cyUXrs3EF_dw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3283110.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/665Ply7Ho1WVf1v1iZlWeg__original/img/2EnN8vsGamxMA1xNG5LcjVTxuiM=/0x0/pic3283110.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Combinatorial", "Components: 3-Dimensional (3D)", "Components: 5 x 5 Grids", "Country: Greece", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Santorini", "Islands: Santorini (Greece)", "Organizations: The Game Artisans of Canada", "Theme: Chibis"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Ancient", "Mythology"], "implementations": ["Santorini: New York", "Santorini"], "mechanics": ["Square Grid", "Team-Based Game", "Three Dimensional Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Gord!"], "artists": ["Lina Cossette", "David Forest"], "publishers": ["Roxley", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Spin Master Ltd."], "description": "Santorini is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition.

Each player selects a Hero avatar, such as a Mercenary, Half-Goblin, or Enchantress, which provides them with unique powers. Then players take turns being the Adventurer, who boldly enters the dungeon seeking glory.\n\nThe Adventurer assembles their party by rolling seven Party Dice, while another player serves as the Dungeon Lord and rolls a number of Dungeon Dice based on how far the Adventurer has progressed through the dungeon. The Adventurer uses Champion, Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Thief, and Scroll faces on the Party Dice to defeat monsters such as oozes and skeletons, to claim treasure inside chests, and to revive downed companions with potions. The Adventurer claims treasure by taking a token at random from inside the treasure chest-shaped game box.\n\nAll this fighting in the dungeon is certain to attract the attention of the boss: The Dragon!\n\nWhen three or more Dragon faces appear on the Dungeon Dice, the Adventurer must battle the Dragon. Defeating the dragon is a team effort, requiring three different companion types. After three rounds, the players add up their experience points and retire to the inn to celebrate their exploits and to plan their next foray into the next deadly dungeon!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "139582", "name": "Dungeon Roll Hero: Guild Leader"}, {"id": "168092", "name": "Dungeon Roll Hero: Time Traveler"}, {"id": "167665", "name": "Dungeon Roll Legends: Hero Booster Pack #2"}, {"id": "226527", "name": "Dungeon Roll: Henchmen"}, {"id": "139583", "name": "Dungeon Roll: Hero Booster Pack #1"}, {"id": "150233", "name": "Dungeon Roll: Winter Heroes Pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 15, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 15, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 7440, "average": 6.12606, "bayesaverage": 5.97326, "stddev": 1.42083, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14369, "trading": 774, "wanting": 47, "wishing": 574, "numcomments": 1928, "numweights": 459, "averageweight": 1.3355, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2518}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 861}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 184, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 67, "recommended_rating": 73, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "2": {"best_rating": 110, "recommended_rating": 49, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "3": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 67, "not_recommended_rating": 51}, "4": {"best_rating": 8, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 99}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 103}}}, "usersrated": 7440.0, "average": 6.12606, "bayesaverage": 5.97326, "stddev": 1.42083, "median": 0.0, "owned": 14369.0, "trading": 774.0, "wanting": 47.0, "wishing": 574.0, "numcomments": 1928.0, "numweights": 459.0, "averageweight": 1.3355, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2518}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 861}], "game_family": "Dungeon Roll", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "92539", "name": "7 Wonders: Leaders", "alternative_names": ["7 Csoda:Vezet\u0151k", "7 Cud\u00f3w \u015awiata: Liderzy", "7 Wonders: L\u00edderes", "\u4e03\u5927\u5947\u8e5f\uff1a\u9818\u8896\u64f4\u5c55"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S8YmOOnFFI58OZ3bBM2A7w__thumb/img/CYxYfPhv5keaEOP1Q7JC3R3WxYk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1046319.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S8YmOOnFFI58OZ3bBM2A7w__original/img/pjr6mqCoXU_DdMnlS2lMDwpyMh4=/0x0/pic1046319.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: 7 Wonders"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "City Building", "Civilization", "Expansion for Base-game"], "implementations": ["7 Wonders (Second Edition): Leaders"], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Antoine Bauza"], "artists": ["Miguel Coimbra"], "publishers": ["Repos Production", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Lautapelit.fi", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "7 Wonders: Leaders adds 42 new cards to the base game of 7 Wonders, comprising four new guilds, one new wonder card, and 36 (+1 blank) white \"Leader\" cards.

Whenever no unplanted box is visible on a bed, you have completed it, then you count your points and replace it with a fresh, unplanted bed. You gain points for all of the visible plant pots and planting bells.\n\nIn more detail, players select various polyomino tiles of flower beds from a central market grid, depending on the location of the \"gardener\", then place them on one of their two personal garden boards. Each board has several garden elements that are worth points when not planted over, and these are scored on two different tracks as soon as a garden has been finished. Crossing over a line on each track awards bonus tokens that can fill in empty spaces or give you a better selection of the flower bed tiles. Whenever a garden is finished, you receive a new one to complete. After the gardener completes her fifth lap around the market, the game enters its last round. The player with the most points from their completed gardens at the end of the game wins.\n\nCottage Garden is the first part of Uwe Rosenberg's puzzle trilogy.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "231506", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017"}, {"id": "234133", "name": "Cottage Garden: The Easter Bunny"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2016, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 6784, "average": 6.9122, "bayesaverage": 6.6381, "stddev": 1.18609, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10449, "trading": 257, "wanting": 333, "wishing": 2005, "numcomments": 1338, "numweights": 144, "averageweight": 1.8958, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 795}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 207}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 76, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 14}, "2": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 46, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "3": {"best_rating": 36, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 43, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 33}}}, "usersrated": 6784.0, "average": 6.9122, "bayesaverage": 6.6381, "stddev": 1.18609, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10449.0, "trading": 257.0, "wanting": 333.0, "wishing": 2005.0, "numcomments": 1338.0, "numweights": 144.0, "averageweight": 1.8958, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 795}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 207}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "204305", "name": "Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: Jack the Ripper & West End Adventures", "alternative_names": ["Sherlock Holmes Consulente Investigativo: Jack lo Squartatore & Avventure nel West End", "Sherlock Holmes Consulente Investigativo: Jack lo Squartatore e Avventure nel West End", "Sherlock Holmes Detective Asesor: Jack el Destripador y Aventuras en el West End", "Sherlock Holmes: D\u00e9tective Conseil \u2013 Jack l'Eventreur et Aventures \u00e0 West End", "Sherlock Holmes: Detektyw doradczy \u2013 \"Zagadka Kuby Rozpruwacza\" i \"Przygody na West Endzie\"", "\u03a3\u03ad\u03c1\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba \u03a7\u03cc\u03bb\u03bc\u03c2 \u0399\u03b4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u0395\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2: \u03a4\u03b6\u03b1\u03ba \u03bf \u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u0393\u03bf\u03c5\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4 \u0395\u03bd\u03c4", "\u0428\u0435\u0440\u043b\u043e\u043a \u0425\u043e\u043b\u043c\u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432-\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442: \u0414\u0436\u0435\u043a \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442-\u044d\u043d\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o3B4ld2Nz9e7wQuRhxJBDw__thumb/img/bYTNTaCtTbEBVmjcyMcyekgIFio=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3238299.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o3B4ld2Nz9e7wQuRhxJBDw__original/img/aMSijyTnYi1Y_3wHtMCfn7Cftho=/0x0/pic3238299.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Books: Mystery Novels", "Books: Sherlock Holmes", "Cities: London (England)", "Country: England", "Game: Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective", "Historical Figures: Jack the Ripper", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery", "Novel-based", "Post-Napoleonic", "Puzzle", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "implementations": ["Sherlock Holmes: West End Adventures"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Storytelling"], "designers": ["Suzanne Goldberg", "Gary Grady", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Ropert"], "artists": ["Bernard Bittler", "Arnaud Demaegd", "Neriac", "Pascal Quidault"], "publishers": ["Asmodee", "Asmodee Italia", "Asterion Press", "CrowD Games", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Space Cowboys"], "description": "Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: Jack the Ripper & West End Adventures is a standalone expansion to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective with updated graphics that features ten more cases to be solved in Sherlock Holmes' Victorian-era London, England.

themselves with secret knowledge, traveled to Dunwich, and brought an end to the strange and terrifying creature that had been terrorizing the secluded village. Their heroic efforts brought peace to the region\u2014for a while\u2014but also left the men scarred by the horrors they had witnessed. Now, one of those professors, Dr. Armitage, has need of your assistance. His colleagues have gone missing, and he fears the worst\u2026\n\nWith five mini cards and 156 full-size cards, The Dunwich Legacy challenges you to find the missing professors and launches you into a campaign that leads to Miskatonic University, the notorious Clover Club, and beyond. Five new investigators arrive to offer their services, armed with fifty-nine new player cards (including a complete playset of each) that allow you to pursue new deck-building strategies and new styles of play. Finally, you'll find all manner of new terrors arrayed against you\u2014from backroom thugs and bad luck to arcane hexes and wholly unnatural abominations.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "317014", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 All or Nothing: Challenge Scenario"}, {"id": "216556", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 Blood on the Altar: Mythos Pack"}, {"id": "237424", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 Jenny Barnes Promo Cards"}, {"id": "224363", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 Lost in Time and Space: Mythos Pack"}, {"id": "309374", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 Read or Die: Challenge Scenario"}, {"id": "260311", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 Return to the Dunwich Legacy"}, {"id": "212734", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 The Essex County Express: Mythos Pack"}, {"id": "210025", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 The Miskatonic Museum: Mythos Pack"}, {"id": "219054", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 Undimensioned and Unseen: Mythos Pack"}, {"id": "221725", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game \u2013 Where Doom Awaits: Mythos Pack"}], "expands": [{"id": "205637", "name": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game"}], "yearpublished": 2017, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 2612, "average": 8.49749, "bayesaverage": 7.32133, "stddev": 1.09955, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15007, "trading": 113, "wanting": 146, "wishing": 503, "numcomments": 525, "numweights": 41, "averageweight": 3.5122, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "4667", "name": "cgs", "friendlyname": "Customizable Rank", "value": null}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 29, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2": {"best_rating": 19, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 6}}}, "usersrated": 2612.0, "average": 8.49749, "bayesaverage": 7.32133, "stddev": 1.09955, "median": 0.0, "owned": 15007.0, "trading": 113.0, "wanting": 146.0, "wishing": 503.0, "numcomments": 525.0, "numweights": 41.0, "averageweight": 3.5122, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": null}, {"id": "4667", "name": "cgs", "friendlyname": "Customizable Rank", "value": null}], "game_family": "Arkham Horror TCG \u2013 The Dunwich Legacy", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 10, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "271324", "name": "It's a Wonderful World", "alternative_names": ["\u00c9 Um Maravilhoso Mundo", "Egy sz\u00e9p \u00faj vil\u00e1g", "Nowy wspania\u0142y \u015bwiat", "Eine wundervolle Welt", "\u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442", "\uc6d0\ub354\ud480 \uc6d4\ub4dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/od4vDTdXGPSVc-kjLqM11w__thumb/img/T2ukKoCUNv2LMxg5GOlOb8WTzNI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4651175.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/od4vDTdXGPSVc-kjLqM11w__original/img/BOBrvNXJsSSJws4rsfWojPfirto=/0x0/pic4651175.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Civilization", "Economic", "Science Fiction"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "End Game Bonuses", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gu\u00e9rard"], "artists": ["Anthony Wolff"], "publishers": ["La Bo\u00eete de Jeu", "Blackrock Games", "Engames", "Fantasmagoria", "FoxGames", "Kobold Spieleverlag", "Lautapelit.fi", "Lucky Duck Games", "MEBO Games", "MTS Games", "Origames", "Reflexshop", "Studio Supernova", "Tranjis Games"], "description": "In It\u2019s a Wonderful World, you are an expanding Empire and must choose your path to your future.

The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.\n\nThe core mechanism of Imperial Settlers is based on concepts from the author's card game 51st State.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "191779", "name": "Brettspiel Easter Basket 2016"}, {"id": "195543", "name": "Imperial Settlers: 3 Is a Magic Number"}, {"id": "245510", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Amazons"}, {"id": "275997", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Armorer & Barracks"}, {"id": "177739", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Atlanteans"}, {"id": "202459", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Aztecs"}, {"id": "216863", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Aztecs \u2013 Common cards"}, {"id": "262641", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Common Village Cards"}, {"id": "195748", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Council Promo"}, {"id": "213749", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Diplomacy Promo Tiles"}, {"id": "179657", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Expedition Tokens"}, {"id": "268798", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Fette Beute"}, {"id": "214313", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Man vs Animals"}, {"id": "261437", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Marketplace"}, {"id": "299277", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Rise of the Empire"}, {"id": "313864", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Rise of the Empire \u2013 Interimperial Organizations Tiles"}, {"id": "230850", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Ruins"}, {"id": "310863", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Storage Box Plus"}, {"id": "189485", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Storage Tiles"}, {"id": "208103", "name": "Imperial Settlers: The Dice Tower Inn"}, {"id": "186857", "name": "Imperial Settlers: The Watchers Guild"}, {"id": "238389", "name": "Imperial Settlers: We Didn't Start The Fire"}, {"id": "169075", "name": "Imperial Settlers: Why Can't We Be Friends"}, {"id": "293240", "name": "Super Power"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 20610, "average": 7.41912, "bayesaverage": 7.25174, "stddev": 1.30465, "median": 0.0, "owned": 27659, "trading": 845, "wanting": 772, "wishing": 4821, "numcomments": 3328, "numweights": 802, "averageweight": 2.7706, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 203}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 156}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 428, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 43, "recommended_rating": 185, "not_recommended_rating": 61}, "2": {"best_rating": 282, "recommended_rating": 97, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "3": {"best_rating": 82, "recommended_rating": 202, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "4": {"best_rating": 35, "recommended_rating": 131, "not_recommended_rating": 149}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 197}}}, "usersrated": 20610.0, "average": 7.41912, "bayesaverage": 7.25174, "stddev": 1.30465, "median": 0.0, "owned": 27659.0, "trading": 845.0, "wanting": 772.0, "wishing": 4821.0, "numcomments": 3328.0, "numweights": 802.0, "averageweight": 2.7706, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 203}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 156}], "game_family": "Imperial Settlers", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 24, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "154458", "name": "Akrotiri", "alternative_names": ["\u30a2\u30af\u30ed\u30c6\u30a3\u30ea", "\u963f\u514b\u7f85\u8482\u91cc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fWm7OcbCdC6NtSDDlxkMqg__thumb/img/QRO6EnTVgARF4N_x30VPAXBlQgc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3539688.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fWm7OcbCdC6NtSDDlxkMqg__original/img/yToX8khU9akPfsESn--F-Pidx0U=/0x0/pic3539688.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Greece", "Organizations: The Game Artisans of Canada", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Region: Aegean Sea"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Economic", "Exploration"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Hand Management", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Jay Cormier", "Sen-Foong Lim"], "artists": ["Chris Quilliams"], "publishers": ["Asmodee", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Hobby Japan", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "Akrotiri places you in the role of an explorer in Classical Greek times, combing the then-uncharted Aegean sea for lost Minoan temples that have long ago fallen into ruin.

But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\n\nAction dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n    War of the Ring Collector's Edition\n    War of the Ring: Second Edition\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) \n\n    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "18034", "name": "War of the Ring: Battles of the Third Age"}, {"id": "188886", "name": "War of the Ring: Scenario \u2013 The Breaking of the Fellowship"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2004, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 9865, "average": 7.76816, "bayesaverage": 7.42428, "stddev": 1.63329, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12684, "trading": 407, "wanting": 431, "wishing": 2038, "numcomments": 2951, "numweights": 1387, "averageweight": 3.8464, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 119}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 27}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 321, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 144}, "2": {"best_rating": 283, "recommended_rating": 29, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "3": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 57, "not_recommended_rating": 139}, "4": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 94, "not_recommended_rating": 100}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 144}}}, "usersrated": 9865.0, "average": 7.76816, "bayesaverage": 7.42428, "stddev": 1.63329, "median": 0.0, "owned": 12684.0, "trading": 407.0, "wanting": 431.0, "wishing": 2038.0, "numcomments": 2951.0, "numweights": 1387.0, "averageweight": 3.8464, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 119}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 27}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "9674", "name": "Ingenious", "alternative_names": ["Einfach Genial", "Ganske enkelt genialt", "G\u00e9nial", "Genial", "G\u00e9nial !", "Genial Connections", "Geniale", "Geniale!", "Genialt", "Genius", "Geniusz", "Helt genialt!", "Kaleidoskop", "Mensa", "Mensa Connections", "MENSA: \u0391\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u0399\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c6\u03c5\u03ad\u03c2!", "Preprosto Genialno", "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30fc\u30cb\u30a2\u30b9", "\u667a\u8c0b\u68cb", "\uc778\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k_dMkjiVuLX8syS0Gt-OGw__thumb/img/telyWJXo1FrPl0aPQ184Yn4L8zw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3958804.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k_dMkjiVuLX8syS0Gt-OGw__original/img/6AOZV2bLlBFQ8vu_HzhDooMOCR8=/0x0/pic3958804.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Ingenious", "Misc: Mensa Select", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": ["Axio", "Einfach Genial Junior", "Ingenious Extreme", "Ingenious: Travel Edition"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Highest-Lowest Scoring", "Pattern Building", "Team-Based Game", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "artists": ["Michaela Kienle", "Fabio Maiorana", "Scott Nicely", "Simone Peruzzi", "Nick Whyles"], "publishers": ["KOSMOS", "999 Games", "Bard Centrum Gier", "Br\u00e4dspel.se", "Brain Games", "Damm / Egmont", "Devir", "Edge Entertainment", "Egmont Litas", "Esdevium", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Giochi Uniti", "Green Board Game Co.", "Hobby Japan", "Hobby World", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "K\u00e4rnan", "Kirjalito", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Laser plus", "Litor", "Mass Games", "MINDOK", "Nexus Editrice", "Piatnik", "Sophisticated Games", "Stupor Mundi", "Tilsit", "White Goblin Games"], "description": "In Ingenious, a.k.a. Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.\n\nIn more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)\n\nWhen no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.\n\nIngenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2004, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 15485, "average": 7.12492, "bayesaverage": 6.95864, "stddev": 1.19136, "median": 0.0, "owned": 18543, "trading": 562, "wanting": 303, "wishing": 1908, "numcomments": 3951, "numweights": 1361, "averageweight": 1.9177, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 418}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 20}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 313, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 90, "not_recommended_rating": 98}, "2": {"best_rating": 181, "recommended_rating": 107, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "3": {"best_rating": 111, "recommended_rating": 152, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "4": {"best_rating": 104, "recommended_rating": 152, "not_recommended_rating": 20}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 141}}}, "usersrated": 15485.0, "average": 7.12492, "bayesaverage": 6.95864, "stddev": 1.19136, "median": 0.0, "owned": 18543.0, "trading": 562.0, "wanting": 303.0, "wishing": 1908.0, "numcomments": 3951.0, "numweights": 1361.0, "averageweight": 1.9177, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 418}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 20}], "game_family": "Ingenious", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "105551", "name": "Archipelago", "alternative_names": ["Archipels"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6kwNH1BGcKpwO6CpV3qRTQ__thumb/img/iJRQEfXxLAa0ekEd2Lw3DedQolI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1640388.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6kwNH1BGcKpwO6CpV3qRTQ__original/img/HVQX0i0uD_sozpHSUgpQwjuMNhg=/0x0/pic1640388.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Meeples (Blue)", "Components: Meeples (Green)", "Components: Meeples (Red)", "Components: Meeples (Yellow)", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play", "Theme: Colonial", "Theme: Tropical"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Economic", "Exploration", "Nautical", "Negotiation", "Renaissance"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Commodity Speculation", "Grid Movement", "Hexagon Grid", "Map Addition", "Modular Board", "Semi-Cooperative Game", "Tile Placement", "Trading", "Traitor Game", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Christophe Boelinger"], "artists": ["Vincent Boulanger", "Isma\u00ebl Pommaz", "Chris Quilliams"], "publishers": ["Ludically", "Asmodee"], "description": "In Archipelago, players are Renaissance European powers competing in the exploration of a Pacific or Caribbean archipelago.

To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.\n\nThe players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.\n\nEach turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.\n\nAs new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "34410", "name": "Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2005, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 150, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 150, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 26562, "average": 7.77503, "bayesaverage": 7.60933, "stddev": 1.47445, "median": 0.0, "owned": 26527, "trading": 537, "wanting": 907, "wishing": 5227, "numcomments": 6096, "numweights": 3166, "averageweight": 3.8048, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 69}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 58}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 716, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 354}, "2": {"best_rating": 152, "recommended_rating": 341, "not_recommended_rating": 108}, "3": {"best_rating": 398, "recommended_rating": 227, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4": {"best_rating": 282, "recommended_rating": 298, "not_recommended_rating": 27}, "5": {"best_rating": 75, "recommended_rating": 269, "not_recommended_rating": 214}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 319}}}, "usersrated": 26562.0, "average": 7.77503, "bayesaverage": 7.60933, "stddev": 1.47445, "median": 0.0, "owned": 26527.0, "trading": 537.0, "wanting": 907.0, "wishing": 5227.0, "numcomments": 6096.0, "numweights": 3166.0, "averageweight": 3.8048, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 69}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 58}], "game_family": "Caylus", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "105134", "name": "Risk Legacy", "alternative_names": ["Risiko Evolution", "Risk Revolution"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LxKu8_oihOQftb2npGvWMw__thumb/img/-g2SLefjovkUxW7H6sFOmAMjfA4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1196938.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LxKu8_oihOQftb2npGvWMw__original/img/-axxPwU_h4uL0sd1s44wzGiVMT0=/0x0/pic1196938.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Map (Global Scale)", "Components: Miniatures", "Game: Risk (Official)", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Mechanism: Legacy", "Region: The World", "Versions & Editions: Legacy Versions of Non-Legacy Games"], "categories": ["Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "implementations": ["Risk"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Legacy Game", "Player Elimination", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Rob Daviau", "Chris Dupuis"], "artists": ["Richard Edwards", "Jason Taylor"], "publishers": ["Hasbro", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Wizards of the Coast"], "description": "This description is spoiler free, containing nothing outside the initial rulebook for the game. Details on why this is important in the description.\n\nRisk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of \"red stars\", otherwise known as victory points (VPs).\n\nWhat's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it \u2013 and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: \"If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.\" This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older \"match three symbols\" style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.\n\nThe rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.\n\nThe winner of each of the first 15 games receives a \"major bonus,\" such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.\n\nIt should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a \"disposable\" game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique.\n\nInitial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "110574", "name": "Risk Legacy: Bonus Cards"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2011, "minplayers": 3, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 7455, "average": 7.43186, "bayesaverage": 7.04986, "stddev": 1.63772, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13015, "trading": 185, "wanting": 321, "wishing": 2585, "numcomments": 1631, "numweights": 271, "averageweight": 2.5867, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 341}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 247}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 125, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 74}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 76}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 33, "not_recommended_rating": 50}, "4": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 70, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "5": {"best_rating": 98, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "5+": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 44}}}, "usersrated": 7455.0, "average": 7.43186, "bayesaverage": 7.04986, "stddev": 1.63772, "median": 0.0, "owned": 13015.0, "trading": 185.0, "wanting": 321.0, "wishing": 2585.0, "numcomments": 1631.0, "numweights": 271.0, "averageweight": 2.5867, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 341}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 247}], "game_family": "Risk (Official)", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "176189", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague", "alternative_names": ["Zombicide: \u010cern\u00fd mor", "Zombicide: Czarna Plaga", "\u0417\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0434. \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0443\u043c\u0430", "\u30be\u30f3\u30d3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9 \u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30b0", "\uc880\ube44\uc0ac\uc774\ub4dc: \ud751\uc0ac\ubcd1"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kVHuMBxmathfnq42XINBQg__thumb/img/u5Fuj4SwZhXElCO3VmrNKkAeXX4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2482309.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kVHuMBxmathfnq42XINBQg__original/img/vs4UlIiZ1p3k5yIJ_vlvd2N-474=/0x0/pic2482309.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler", "Components: Miniatures", "Creatures: Zombies", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Zombicide", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Theme: Post-Apocalyptic"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Horror", "Medieval", "Miniatures", "Zombies"], "implementations": ["Zombicide"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Rapha\u00ebl Guiton", "Jean-Baptiste Lullien", "Nicolas Raoult"], "artists": ["Nicolas Fructus", "J\u00e9r\u00e9my Masson"], "publishers": ["Cool Mini Or Not", "Guillotine Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Arclight", "Asterion Press", "BoardM Factory", "CMON Limited", "Edge Entertainment", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Hobby World", "Portal Games"], "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nZombicide: Black Plague takes the zombie apocalypse into a fantastical medieval setting! The arcane powers of the Necromancers have unleashed a zombie invasion in the age of swords and sorcery, and it's up to your group of straggling survivors to not only stay alive during these dark times, but to take back the realm and punish those responsible for the apocalypse!\n\nZombicide: Black Plague allows you take control of paladins, dwarves, knights, and magicians, wielding powerful swords, crossbows, and even magic spells to defeat the zombie hordes and its Necromancer overlords. The classic Zombicide rules have been revamped for this new incarnation of the game, while still retaining the nonstop action, tense atmosphere and easy-to-learn rules that made Zombicide a classic. Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead, pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments, or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire!\n\nTake on the zombie invasion from the medieval streets to secret vaults that create quick passages through the citadel (and often hold special artifacts). Chase down the elusive Necromancers to keep them from multiplying the zombie masses. And tackle a whole new set of missions through which your group of survivors will become the heroes of the land (or the last victims of the zombie massacre).\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "199743", "name": "Cool Mini Or Not Promo Pack 2016"}, {"id": "236775", "name": "Massive Darkness: Black Plague Crossover Set"}, {"id": "179256", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Adrian Smith"}, {"id": "179195", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Carl Critchlow"}, {"id": "180168", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Edouard Guiton"}, {"id": "179391", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Gipi"}, {"id": "179896", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 John Howe"}, {"id": "180358", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Jovem Nerd"}, {"id": "179692", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Karl Kopinski"}, {"id": "179168", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Marc Simonetti"}, {"id": "180166", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Na\u00efade"}, {"id": "180329", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Neal Adams"}, {"id": "179607", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Paolo Parente"}, {"id": "179186", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Paul Bonner"}, {"id": "179819", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Special Guest Box \u2013 Stefan Kopinski"}, {"id": "180483", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague Zombie Bosses Abomination Pack"}, {"id": "227976", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Abominarat and Dr. Stormcrow"}, {"id": "201029", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Benson"}, {"id": "227689", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Bob and Montalban"}, {"id": "180236", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Deadeye Walkers"}, {"id": "234735", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Erik Summoner"}, {"id": "228919", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Game Night Kit 1"}, {"id": "311069", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Grin and Scowl"}, {"id": "180426", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Grom and Thalia"}, {"id": "179158", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Hero Box 1"}, {"id": "201030", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Homer"}, {"id": "200750", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Huntsman Pack"}, {"id": "199739", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Ice Blast Promo Card"}, {"id": "200751", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Knight Pack"}, {"id": "179634", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Murder of Crowz"}, {"id": "179538", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 NPC-1"}, {"id": "179539", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 NPC-2"}, {"id": "228658", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Troy and Evil Troy"}, {"id": "230343", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Ultimate Survivors"}, {"id": "203886", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Willow"}, {"id": "178485", "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Wulfsburg"}, {"id": "229773", "name": "Zombicide: Green Horde Special Guest Box \u2013 Adrian Smith 2"}, {"id": "229770", "name": "Zombicide: Green Horde Special Guest Box \u2013 Paul Bonner 2"}, {"id": "230143", "name": "Zombicide: Green Horde Special Guest Box \u2013 Sean A.

Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that's as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player's 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy).\n\nWhen a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located. In addition, you can't place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round.

Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.\n\nIn the

goals (e.g. detouring for treasure).  The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.\n\nSetting: Jamaica, 1675.\nAfter a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former \"colleagues\" to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the \"good old days,\" Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.\n\nGoal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.\n\nGameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five \"holds\" of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as \"captain,\" with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the \"day\" and which to the \"night.\" Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to \"day\" - and one on the right (\"night\"). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a \"combat\" die, but players may improve their chances by using \"gunpowder\" tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "39166", "name": "Jamaica: Extra Treasures"}, {"id": "204807", "name": "Jamaica: The Crew"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2007, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 15970, "average": 7.05772, "bayesaverage": 6.89254, "stddev": 1.248, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21449, "trading": 400, "wanting": 714, "wishing": 4097, "numcomments": 3292, "numweights": 748, "averageweight": 1.6511, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 486}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 115}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 245, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 153}, "2": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 63, "not_recommended_rating": 125}, "3": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 121, "not_recommended_rating": 58}, "4": {"best_rating": 73, "recommended_rating": 134, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 97, "recommended_rating": 115, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "6": {"best_rating": 147, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "6+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 94}}}, "usersrated": 15970.0, "average": 7.05772, "bayesaverage": 6.89254, "stddev": 1.248, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21449.0, "trading": 400.0, "wanting": 714.0, "wishing": 4097.0, "numcomments": 3292.0, "numweights": 748.0, "averageweight": 1.6511, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 486}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 115}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "6", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "28143", "name": "Race for the Galaxy", "alternative_names": ["Dobyvatel\u00e9 Vesm\u00edru", "Galaxia: La conquista", "Race for the Galaxy: Narodziny Imperi\u00f3w", "\u0411\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30fc", "\u9280\u6cb3\u7af6\u9010 (\u94f6\u6cb3\u7ade\u9010)", "\ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \ud3ec \ub354 \uac24\ub7ed\uc2dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__thumb/img/xLs-ldTPwaADbvzkOpF0sgWzwck=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5261714.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__original/img/EMaVVpr662kgp_T8uf4UkFvIkqE=/0x0/pic5261714.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards", "Game: Race for the Galaxy", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Civilization", "Economic", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "implementations": ["Jump Drive", "New Frontiers", "Roll for the Galaxy"], "mechanics": ["Follow", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Turn Order: Role Order", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Thomas Lehmann"], "artists": ["Martin Hoffmann", "Claus Stephan", "Mirko Suzuki"], "publishers": ["Rio Grande Games", "ABACUSSPIELE", "Albi", "Ediciones MasQueOca", "Gabinete L\u00fadico", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Gamesinitaly", "Ghenos Games", "Giochix.it", "Hobby Japan", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Matagot", "Pegasus Spiele", "Portal Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Smart Ltd", "Wargames Club Publishing", "Ystari Games"], "description": "2018 UPDATE: The second edition of the game is improved for color-blindness and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds. The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.\n\nIn the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.\n\nAt the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "145148", "name": "Patronage (fan expansion for Race for the Galaxy)"}, {"id": "92932", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Alien Artifacts"}, {"id": "270439", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Das Erweiterungs-Bundle"}, {"id": "242309", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: New Worlds Promo"}, {"id": "40210", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Rebel vs Imperium"}, {"id": "268829", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Retrofit Cards"}, {"id": "66121", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: The Brink of War"}, {"id": "34499", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm"}, {"id": "161599", "name": "Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Invasion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2007, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 45635, "average": 7.75988, "bayesaverage": 7.65738, "stddev": 1.48202, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54949, "trading": 1058, "wanting": 1104, "wishing": 8627, "numcomments": 9514, "numweights": 3445, "averageweight": 2.9808, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 57}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 55}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 1056, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 96, "not_recommended_rating": 451}, "2": {"best_rating": 683, "recommended_rating": 272, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "3": {"best_rating": 333, "recommended_rating": 531, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "4": {"best_rating": 406, "recommended_rating": 415, "not_recommended_rating": 62}, "4+": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 92, "not_recommended_rating": 388}}}, "usersrated": 45635.0, "average": 7.75988, "bayesaverage": 7.65738, "stddev": 1.48202, "median": 0.0, "owned": 54949.0, "trading": 1058.0, "wanting": 1104.0, "wishing": 8627.0, "numcomments": 9514.0, "numweights": 3445.0, "averageweight": 2.9808, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 57}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 55}], "game_family": "Race for the Galaxy", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "38453", "name": "Space Alert", "alternative_names": ["\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30a2\u30e9\u30fc\u30c8", "\u592a\u7a7a\u8b66\u5831"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__thumb/img/9tewdwxUKcqikj0QlVSUmwRPK68=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic384313.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__original/img/bASSKEPd4V_exZ73z4EG0pg9ZrI=/0x0/pic384313.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Compact Discs (CDs)", "Components: Miniatures", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Electronic", "Real-time", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Area Movement", "Cooperative Game", "Elapsed Real Time Ending", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Solo / Solitaire Game"], "designers": ["Vlaada Chv\u00e1til"], "artists": ["Radim Pech", "Milan Vavro\u0148"], "publishers": ["Czech Games Edition", "Devir", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "HomoLudicus", "IELLO", "Magellan", "New Games Order, LLC", "One Moment Games", "Quined White Goblin Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Red Glove", "REXhry", "Rio Grande Games"], "description": "Space Alert is a cooperative team survival game.

The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship.

Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.\n\nGoal:\n\nEach player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTo begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.\n\nActual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.\n\nPlayers start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.\n\nIn the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.\n\nOnce players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.\n\nRevised using:\n\n    Talisman: Upgrade Pack\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "67059", "name": "Talisman (4th Edition): Arena"}, {"id": "67299", "name": "Talisman (4th Edition): Optional Characters"}, {"id": "67060", "name": "Talisman (4th Edition): Rod of Ruin"}, {"id": "67054", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Crown of Command"}, {"id": "67056", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Danse Macabre"}, {"id": "67058", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Doppelganger"}, {"id": "67057", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Instructor"}, {"id": "133745", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Mephisto #48 Promo Characters"}, {"id": "121786", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Blood Moon Expansion"}, {"id": "189950", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Cataclysm Expansion"}, {"id": "131816", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The City Expansion"}, {"id": "169254", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Deep Realms Expansion"}, {"id": "99815", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Dragon Expansion"}, {"id": "41064", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Dungeon Expansion"}, {"id": "152318", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Firelands Expansion"}, {"id": "54475", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Frostmarch Expansion"}, {"id": "177211", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Harbinger Expansion"}, {"id": "67051", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Highland Expansion"}, {"id": "248506", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Lost Realms"}, {"id": "152319", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Nether Realm Expansion"}, {"id": "38025", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Reaper Expansion"}, {"id": "75857", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Sacred Pool Expansion"}, {"id": "158979", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Woodland Expansion"}, {"id": "65480", "name": "Talisman Quests: The Rainforest (fan expansion for Talisman)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2007, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 12985, "average": 6.52491, "bayesaverage": 6.27999, "stddev": 1.85813, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19470, "trading": 526, "wanting": 196, "wishing": 1546, "numcomments": 2800, "numweights": 810, "averageweight": 2.1901, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1448}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 431}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 220, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 126}, "2": {"best_rating": 14, "recommended_rating": 102, "not_recommended_rating": 53}, "3": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 107, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "4": {"best_rating": 133, "recommended_rating": 62, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 48, "recommended_rating": 83, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "6": {"best_rating": 22, "recommended_rating": 66, "not_recommended_rating": 66}, "6+": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 14, "not_recommended_rating": 112}}}, "usersrated": 12985.0, "average": 6.52491, "bayesaverage": 6.27999, "stddev": 1.85813, "median": 0.0, "owned": 19470.0, "trading": 526.0, "wanting": 196.0, "wishing": 1546.0, "numcomments": 2800.0, "numweights": 810.0, "averageweight": 2.1901, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1448}, {"id": "5496", "name": "thematic", "friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "value": 431}], "game_family": "Talisman", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 24, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "27708", "name": "1960: The Making of the President", "alternative_names": ["1960: Carrera hacia la Casa Blanca", "1960: Kennedy contre Nixon"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p-k_CqUvJzTcMMz4ms7f_Q__thumb/img/LZFIiC173jPXvtxUGeNh9eGedpc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499166.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p-k_CqUvJzTcMMz4ms7f_Q__original/img/V2ZLDmIl-5JA0_C10ZmDRkd_PfA=/0x0/pic3499166.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: USA", "Decades: The 1960's", "History: Cold War", "Players: Two Player Only Games", "Political: Elections"], "categories": ["Political"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action/Event", "Area Majority / Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management"], "designers": ["Christian Leonhard", "Jason Matthews"], "artists": ["Josh Cappel", "Donal Hegarty", "Rodger B.

The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.\n\n\"In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.\n\n\"The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960\u2014a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon\u2019s lazy shave, President Eisenhower\u2019s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state\u2019s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.\n\n\"As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you.

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills.

To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.\n\nTaking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary.

These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.\n\nThe setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate \u2014 anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable \u2014 failure \u2014 which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.\n\nOver the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.\n\nLike the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:\n\n\n    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (\"nice\" or \"mean\") to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.\n    Two independent player-influenced game timers \u2014 the factory production cycle and work week clock \u2014 provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.\n    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.\n    A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.\n    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.\n\n\nIf you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 5615, "average": 7.84789, "bayesaverage": 7.31826, "stddev": 1.42473, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7767, "trading": 197, "wanting": 554, "wishing": 2224, "numcomments": 1149, "numweights": 487, "averageweight": 4.3552, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 174}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 97}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 120, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 50}, "2": {"best_rating": 18, "recommended_rating": 63, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "3": {"best_rating": 54, "recommended_rating": 44, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "4": {"best_rating": 61, "recommended_rating": 36, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 46}}}, "usersrated": 5615.0, "average": 7.84789, "bayesaverage": 7.31826, "stddev": 1.42473, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7767.0, "trading": 197.0, "wanting": 554.0, "wishing": 2224.0, "numcomments": 1149.0, "numweights": 487.0, "averageweight": 4.3552, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 174}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 97}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 0, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "104557", "name": "Dominion: Hinterlands", "alternative_names": ["Dominion: Comarcas", "Dominion: Het Achterland", "Dominion: Hinterland", "Dominion: L'Arri\u00e8re-Pays", "Dominion: Nuovi Orizzonti", "Dominion: Rajaseudut", "Dominion: Vzd\u00e1len\u00e9 kraje", "\u30c9\u30df\u30cb\u30aa\u30f3\uff1a\u7570\u90f7"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J6mcvuL1AbP3n5B-hqH3ng__thumb/img/Ti_hqI1AdEMzsCHHW3xVVB3PEz0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1077695.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J6mcvuL1AbP3n5B-hqH3ng__original/img/acZGk3tcNfJF5w_RFn3ogIsudiE=/0x0/pic1077695.jpg", "expansion": true, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Dominion"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Medieval"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "designers": ["Donald X.

China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. He inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. He resided in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified, and expanded. Around this period, China was under heavy attack from the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of the Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty.\n\nThe country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. Even though the penalties for corruption were very high, the highest Officials of the Forbidden City would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, by accepting gifts of petitioners, and returning one of seemingly lower value.\n\nG\u00f9g\u00c5\u008dng uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. Players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by exchanging gifts with Officials. The gift cards you offer as a player have to be of a higher value than the one you receive, forcing you to make strategic choices regarding which actions you want to take each turn. You will travel around China, sail down the Grand Canal, purchase precious jade, help construct the Great Wall, secure advantages through decrees, influence the game through intrigue, and ultimately, receive an audience with the emperor. If only 1 player succeeds in doing so, he wins. If several players succeed, the player with the most VPs among those players wins the game.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n(Espa\u00f1ol)\n\nChina, 1570.

All of the explorers start in the center tile \u2013 the safe room \u2013 and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:\n\n\n    A cursed mask \u2013 this die is set aside when rolled.\n    A golden mask \u2013 each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.\n    A red torch or blue key \u2013 these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.\n    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die \u2013 you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.\n\n\nEscape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you \"discover\" magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.\n\nThe real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.\n\nOnce the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.\n\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the \"Treasures\" module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the \"Curses\" module, some tiles \"curse\" players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "310234", "name": "Escape: Queenie Box"}, {"id": "310200", "name": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple \u2013 Dice Shrine Chambers"}, {"id": "128236", "name": "Escape:

Peter Lee\nThe master of Ravenloft is having guests for dinner \u2013 and you are invited!\nEvil lurks in the towers and dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and only heroes of exceptional bravery can survive the horrors within. Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative gameplay.\n\nEach player selects a hero; a ranger, rogue, warrior, cleric, or wizard. On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest.

Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.\n\nIn Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.\n\nPlayers use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "98663", "name": "Schmuck und Handel (fan expansion for Stone Age)"}, {"id": "225880", "name": "Stadt Land Spielt Limitierte Sonderdrucke 2013"}, {"id": "147541", "name": "Stone Age: Casino"}, {"id": "107576", "name": "Stone Age: The Expansion"}, {"id": "238004", "name": "Stone Age: The Mammoth Herd"}, {"id": "38876", "name": "Stone Age: The New Huts"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2008, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 90, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 90, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 44140, "average": 7.56905, "bayesaverage": 7.45799, "stddev": 1.2431, "median": 0.0, "owned": 46681, "trading": 507, "wanting": 1590, "wishing": 9497, "numcomments": 7706, "numweights": 2762, "averageweight": 2.4794, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 110}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 99}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 12}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 852, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 430}, "2": {"best_rating": 152, "recommended_rating": 427, "not_recommended_rating": 123}, "3": {"best_rating": 219, "recommended_rating": 480, "not_recommended_rating": 21}, "4": {"best_rating": 547, "recommended_rating": 199, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "4+": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 339}}}, "usersrated": 44140.0, "average": 7.56905, "bayesaverage": 7.45799, "stddev": 1.2431, "median": 0.0, "owned": 46681.0, "trading": 507.0, "wanting": 1590.0, "wishing": 9497.0, "numcomments": 7706.0, "numweights": 2762.0, "averageweight": 2.4794, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 110}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 99}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 12}], "game_family": "Stone Age", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 6, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "36932", "name": "Claustrophobia", "alternative_names": ["\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0444\u043e\u0431\u0438\u044f"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OUNLwXPLWGBgqlooTuADeQ__thumb/img/_HYYNg_j_lEywSiF2PJEIS2_5WU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic570518.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OUNLwXPLWGBgqlooTuADeQ__original/img/tZKSyqTq-T5VfdD3IclQJIim44M=/0x0/pic570518.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler", "Components: Miniatures", "Players: Two Player Only Games"], "categories": ["Horror", "Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "implementations": ["Claustrophobia 1643"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Line of Sight", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Croc"], "artists": ["Bertrand Benoit", "Aleksi Briclot", "St\u00e9phane Gantiez"], "publishers": ["Asmodee", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "Claustrophobia is a miniatures-based survival game set within the universe of Hell Dorado.\n\nThe box contains pre-painted miniatures which are placed on large tiles showing the dungeon spaces.

Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!\n\nWhatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.\n\nStar Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...\n\nThe Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a \"home\" tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.\n\nIn spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.\n\nKeyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.\n\nKeyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the \"Key\" series from R&D Games set in the medieval \"Key\" land.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "256951", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018"}, {"id": "162647", "name": "Keyflower: Beekeeper"}, {"id": "245169", "name": "Keyflower: Boat 7"}, {"id": "264045", "name": "Keyflower: Delivery Man"}, {"id": "261369", "name": "Keyflower: Developer"}, {"id": "141816", "name": "Keyflower: Emporium & Monument"}, {"id": "140936", "name": "Keyflower: Key Celeste"}, {"id": "205504", "name": "Keyflower: Keymelequin"}, {"id": "180037", "name": "Keyflower: Pig Shelter"}, {"id": "245170", "name": "Keyflower: Sorcerer"}, {"id": "147380", "name": "Keyflower: Storyteller"}, {"id": "144058", "name": "Keyflower: The Farmers"}, {"id": "163572", "name": "Keyflower: The Merchants"}, {"id": "163742", "name": "Keyflower: Trader"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 90, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 18622, "average": 7.80783, "bayesaverage": 7.6243, "stddev": 1.30568, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21745, "trading": 317, "wanting": 1217, "wishing": 5761, "numcomments": 3359, "numweights": 878, "averageweight": 3.3462, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 65}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 54}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 350, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 146}, "2": {"best_rating": 60, "recommended_rating": 187, "not_recommended_rating": 41}, "3": {"best_rating": 114, "recommended_rating": 151, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "4": {"best_rating": 188, "recommended_rating": 87, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "5": {"best_rating": 41, "recommended_rating": 141, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "6": {"best_rating": 15, "recommended_rating": 110, "not_recommended_rating": 89}, "6+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 118}}}, "usersrated": 18622.0, "average": 7.80783, "bayesaverage": 7.6243, "stddev": 1.30568, "median": 0.0, "owned": 21745.0, "trading": 317.0, "wanting": 1217.0, "wishing": 5761.0, "numcomments": 3359.0, "numweights": 878.0, "averageweight": 3.3462, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 65}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 54}], "game_family": "Keyflower", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 14, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "122522", "name": "Smash Up", "alternative_names": ["!\u05d4\u05ea\u05e0\u05d2\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea", "Hust\u00e1 mela", "\u0417\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441", "\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c1DOHkXD35OcqfPoxoSXlA__thumb/img/kdzBzdj4prsoztFNEFZ6eWv1RVI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1269874.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c1DOHkXD35OcqfPoxoSXlA__original/img/OS_VOWW91RutPZMh-uFK0CD4Nnw=/0x0/pic1269874.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Smash Up"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Humor", "Pirates", "Science Fiction", "Zombies"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Deck Construction", "Hand Management", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers", "Variable Setup"], "designers": ["Paul Peterson"], "artists": ["Dave Allsop", "Bruno Balixa", "Conceptopolis", "Francisco Rico Torres"], "publishers": ["Alderac Entertainment Group", "Arclight", "Bard Centrum Gier", "Edge Entertainment", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "HaKubia", "Hobby World", "IELLO", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "MYBG Co., Ltd.", "NeoTroy Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "REXhry", "uplay.it edizioni"], "description": "The \"shufflebuilding\" game Smash Up begins with a simple premise: take the 20-card decks of two factions, shuffle them into a deck of forty cards, then compete to crush more Bases than your opponents! Each faction involves a different gaming mechanism - the pirates move the cards, the zombies bring back the cards from the discard pile, the dinosaurs have enormous power - and each combination of factions brings a different gaming experience.\n\nDuring the game, basic cards (each with their own difficulties and abilities) are at stake. You try to have the most power on the basis of your minions when the base is broken. Sounds easy? Is it easy when an opponent's Alien-Ninja decides to tie your minions to other Bases - flat Murder them? What happens when the Pirate-Dinosaur Full Sails player and frees King Rex to trample your minions in the ground, or when wizard-zombies use their mystic power to create an outbreak, suddenly flooding minions on the base of the discard pile? Or if you were facing a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an epidemic of massive beasts at the same time?!?\n\nWhen a base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, brother, next time.\n\nWith eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try. Pirate-Aliens play different Ninja-Aliens, for example. Which one will you use to crush your opponents?\n\nAnd did we mention dinosaurs have laser beams?\n\nIntegrates with:\n\n    Smash Up: Munchkin\n    Smash Up: Pretty Pretty Smash Up\n    Smash Up: The Big Geeky Box\n    Smash Up: Science Fiction Double Feature\n    Smash Up: Monster Smash\n    Smash Up: The Obligatory Cthulhu Set\n    Smash Up: Awesome Level 9000\n    Smash Up: It's Your Fault!\n    Smash Up: Cease and Desist\n\n\n\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "220266", "name": "Smash Up: All Stars"}, {"id": "322233", "name": "Smash Up: Goblins"}, {"id": "285585", "name": "Smash Up: Penguins"}, {"id": "220188", "name": "Smash Up: Sheep"}, {"id": "157427", "name": "Smash Up: The Big Geeky Box"}, {"id": "247898", "name": "Smash Up: The Bigger Geekier Box"}, {"id": "255207", "name": "Smash Up: Titans"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 23233, "average": 6.75688, "bayesaverage": 6.60183, "stddev": 1.49372, "median": 0.0, "owned": 38136, "trading": 1325, "wanting": 228, "wishing": 2199, "numcomments": 3944, "numweights": 892, "averageweight": 2.0605, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 840}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 619}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 357, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 227}, "2": {"best_rating": 65, "recommended_rating": 162, "not_recommended_rating": 72}, "3": {"best_rating": 199, "recommended_rating": 109, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "4": {"best_rating": 120, "recommended_rating": 141, "not_recommended_rating": 50}, "4+": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 28, "not_recommended_rating": 173}}}, "usersrated": 23233.0, "average": 6.75688, "bayesaverage": 6.60183, "stddev": 1.49372, "median": 0.0, "owned": 38136.0, "trading": 1325.0, "wanting": 228.0, "wishing": 2199.0, "numcomments": 3944.0, "numweights": 892.0, "averageweight": 2.0605, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 840}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 619}], "game_family": "Smash Up", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 7, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "98778", "name": "Hanabi", "alternative_names": ["Hanabi Deluxe", "Hanabi Extra", "Hanabi Fun and Easy", "Hanabi Pocket", "\u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1", "\u0425\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0431\u0438", "\u82b1\u706b", "\u82b1\u706b", "\ud558\ub098\ube44"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDVksMwfcqoem1k_xtZrOA__thumb/img/amCeCcEKhYGbVtDvpvIMnu3qTg0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2007286.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDVksMwfcqoem1k_xtZrOA__original/img/Wkrf8z3pMlOFKwxafbw9-Ob404s=/0x0/pic2007286.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Japan", "Game: Hanabi", "Mechanism: Deduction \u2013 Blind Man's Bluff"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Memory"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Communication Limits", "Cooperative Game", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Roles with Asymmetric Information", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Antoine Bauza"], "artists": ["Antoine Bauza", "G\u00e9rald Guerlais", "Albertine Ralenti"], "publishers": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Cocktail Games", "Les 12 Singes", "Asmodee", "Brain Games", "Broadway Toys LTD", "Competo / Marektoy", "cutia.ro", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Happy Baobab", "Hobby Japan", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Oliphante", "PaperGames (III)", "R&R Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "REXhry", "Spin Master Ltd.", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "description": "Hanabi\u2014named for the Japanese word for \"fireworks\"\u2014is a cooperative game in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by placing the cards on the table in the right order.

Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.\n\nAn extra suit of cards, rainbow colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play.\n\nHanabi was originally published as part of Hanabi & Ikebana.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "121996", "name": "Hanabi: Avalanche de couleurs"}, {"id": "323999", "name": "Hanabi: Black Powder Expansion"}, {"id": "183833", "name": "Hanabi: Die Bonus-Pl\u00e4ttchen"}, {"id": "149310", "name": "Hanabi: \u00a1Gana o explota!"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2010, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 25, "minplaytime": 25, "maxplaytime": 25, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 37995, "average": 7.0935, "bayesaverage": 6.99831, "stddev": 1.40076, "median": 0.0, "owned": 62096, "trading": 1288, "wanting": 275, "wishing": 3174, "numcomments": 6517, "numweights": 1478, "averageweight": 1.6989, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 380}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 93}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 470, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 311}, "2": {"best_rating": 57, "recommended_rating": 214, "not_recommended_rating": 144}, "3": {"best_rating": 137, "recommended_rating": 242, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "4": {"best_rating": 277, "recommended_rating": 122, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "5": {"best_rating": 69, "recommended_rating": 271, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 228}}}, "usersrated": 37995.0, "average": 7.0935, "bayesaverage": 6.99831, "stddev": 1.40076, "median": 0.0, "owned": 62096.0, "trading": 1288.0, "wanting": 275.0, "wishing": 3174.0, "numcomments": 6517.0, "numweights": 1478.0, "averageweight": 1.6989, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 380}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 93}], "game_family": "Hanabi", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "143519", "name": "Quantum", "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bgle3gjd2wTrD31ps_z92w__thumb/img/bjSkZpezCxJBqtucXslJAX2laKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1727619.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bgle3gjd2wTrD31ps_z92w__original/img/kUKMz0IfUvlqwtGO7FcPrlJHZdc=/0x0/pic1727619.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": [], "categories": ["Dice", "Fighting", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Square Grid"], "designers": ["Eric Zimmerman"], "artists": ["Georges Bouchelaghem", "Kieran Yanner"], "publishers": ["Funforge", "Asterion Press", "Gen-X Games", "Passport Game Studios"], "description": "Send out the scouts! Position the Flagship in tactical orbit! And reconfigure that Battlestation into something new! Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.\n\nIn Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.\n\nEach type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.\n\nYou win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.\n\nWith elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.\n\nQuantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "188030", "name": "Quantum: Entanglement Add-on Pack"}, {"id": "149799", "name": "Quantum: The Void"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 60, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 6432, "average": 7.28742, "bayesaverage": 6.9082, "stddev": 1.39276, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7544, "trading": 181, "wanting": 612, "wishing": 2668, "numcomments": 1225, "numweights": 253, "averageweight": 2.4466, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 475}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 301}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 116, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 64}, "2": {"best_rating": 28, "recommended_rating": 51, "not_recommended_rating": 24}, "3": {"best_rating": 38, "recommended_rating": 56, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 64, "recommended_rating": 34, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "4+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 52}}}, "usersrated": 6432.0, "average": 7.28742, "bayesaverage": 6.9082, "stddev": 1.39276, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7544.0, "trading": 181.0, "wanting": 612.0, "wishing": 2668.0, "numcomments": 1225.0, "numweights": 253.0, "averageweight": 2.4466, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 475}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 301}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 2, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "143693", "name": "Glass Road", "alternative_names": ["De Glasstraat", "Die Glasstra\u00dfe", "La Route du Verre", "Szklany Szlak", "\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9", "\u73bb\u7483\u4e4b\u8def", "\uae00\ub798\uc2a4 \ub85c\ub4dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qoiAYXE62f638RkxN3rFYQ__thumb/img/3QOnJY-sIe8i8JimVuYLvEPLUo4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3505745.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qoiAYXE62f638RkxN3rFYQ__original/img/r4Pjyfk-7ihYd3E9a9amLKQzZnA=/0x0/pic3505745.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Country: Germany", "Game: Glass Road", "Mechanism: Tableau Building", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg)"], "categories": ["City Building", "Economic", "Medieval"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Tile Placement", "Variable Phase Order"], "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "artists": ["Dennis Lohausen"], "publishers": ["Feuerland Spiele", "Cranio Creations", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Lacerta", "Maldito Games", "Mayfair Games", "MTS Games", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (Ten Days Games)", "Toy Box Games", "White Goblin Games", "Z-Man Games, Inc."], "description": "Glass Road is a game that commemorates the 700-year-old tradition of glass-making in the Bavarian Forest. (Today the Glass Road is a route through the Bavarian Forest that takes visitors to many of the old glass houses and museums of that region.) You must skillfully manage your glass and brick production in order to build the right structures that help you to keep your business flowing. Cut the forest to keep the fires burning in the ovens, and spread and remove ponds, pits and groves to supply yourself with the items you need. Fifteen specialists are there at your side to carry out your orders...\n\nThe game consists of four building periods. Each player has an identical set of fifteen specialist cards, and each specialist comes with two abilities. At the beginning of each building period, each player needs to choose a hand of five specialists. If he then plays a specialist that no other player has remaining in his hand, he may use both abilities of that card; if two or more players play the same specialist, each of them may use only one of the two abilities. Exploiting the abilities of the specialists lets you collect resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g., ponds and pits), and build a variety of buildings. There are three types of buildings:\n\n\n     Processing buildings\n     Immediate buildings with a one-time effect \n     Buildings that provide bonus points at the end of the game for various accomplishments\n\n\nMastering the balance of knowing the best specialist card to play and being flexible about when you play it \u2013 together with assembling a clever combination of buildings \u2013 is the key to this game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "189653", "name": "Die Glasstra\u00dfe: Die Adventskalendererweiterung"}, {"id": "190602", "name": "Die Glasstra\u00dfe: Harlekin"}, {"id": "167567", "name": "Die Glasstra\u00dfe: Oktoberfest"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 80, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 80, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 8919, "average": 7.44886, "bayesaverage": 7.1617, "stddev": 1.22796, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10806, "trading": 173, "wanting": 865, "wishing": 3112, "numcomments": 1876, "numweights": 472, "averageweight": 2.9746, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 258}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 167}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 201, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 63, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "2": {"best_rating": 94, "recommended_rating": 67, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "3": {"best_rating": 47, "recommended_rating": 84, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 50, "recommended_rating": 73, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 60}}}, "usersrated": 8919.0, "average": 7.44886, "bayesaverage": 7.1617, "stddev": 1.22796, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10806.0, "trading": 173.0, "wanting": 865.0, "wishing": 3112.0, "numcomments": 1876.0, "numweights": 472.0, "averageweight": 2.9746, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 258}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 167}], "game_family": "Glass Road", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "2", "num_expansions": 4, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "143741", "name": "BANG!

Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?\n\nBANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.\n\nEach player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.\n\nIf a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who'll get his shot off first?

A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single die.\n\nArmed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal from your neighbors' coffers. Just make sure they aren't doing the same to you!\n\nMachi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on their own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than their rivals. On their turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, they get the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your dice (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of their city on future turns. The first player to construct all of their landmarks wins!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "207143", "name": "Machi Koro: Dice Tower Promo Cards"}, {"id": "171044", "name": "Machi Koro: Fabrique de jouets du P\u00e8re No\u00ebl"}, {"id": "158624", "name": "Machi Koro: Gaming Mega Store"}, {"id": "181336", "name": "Machi Koro: Gro\u00dfstadt-Erweiterung"}, {"id": "143789", "name": "Machi Koro: Harbor"}, {"id": "160154", "name": "Machi Koro: Millionaire's Row"}, {"id": "280191", "name": "Machi Koro: The Harbor & Millionaire's Row Expansions"}, {"id": "185279", "name": "Minivilles: 5-6 Extension"}, {"id": "186885", "name": "Stadt Land Spielt Limitierte Sonderdrucke 2015"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 25509, "average": 6.62689, "bayesaverage": 6.52302, "stddev": 1.36785, "median": 0.0, "owned": 39551, "trading": 1209, "wanting": 267, "wishing": 2554, "numcomments": 4509, "numweights": 983, "averageweight": 1.531, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 979}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 295}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 276, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 170}, "2": {"best_rating": 23, "recommended_rating": 131, "not_recommended_rating": 79}, "3": {"best_rating": 84, "recommended_rating": 141, "not_recommended_rating": 7}, "4": {"best_rating": 174, "recommended_rating": 66, "not_recommended_rating": 12}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 109}}}, "usersrated": 25509.0, "average": 6.62689, "bayesaverage": 6.52302, "stddev": 1.36785, "median": 0.0, "owned": 39551.0, "trading": 1209.0, "wanting": 267.0, "wishing": 2554.0, "numcomments": 4509.0, "numweights": 983.0, "averageweight": 1.531, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 979}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 295}], "game_family": "Machi Koro", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 9, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "170771", "name": "Sword & Sorcery", "alternative_names": ["Sword & Sorcery: Esp\u00edritos Imortais", "Sword & Sorcery: Immortal Souls", "Sword & Sorcery: Les \u00e2mes immortelles", "Sword & Sorcery: Nie\u015bmiertelne dusze", "Sword & Sorcery: Unsterbliche Seelen", "\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a \u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FNVnu-vB8WjyQTf63Ssvig__thumb/img/byFYJhsrFZ3Z5rd0Ef72GxmYoqM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2673763.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FNVnu-vB8WjyQTf63Ssvig__original/img/HOvic09lBktj6TInYIEWVRkCBBg=/0x0/pic2673763.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler", "Components: Miniatures", "Creatures: Monsters", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Sword & Sorcery", "Mechanism: Campaign Games", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Role Playing", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Simone Romano", "Nunzio Surace"], "artists": ["Mario Barbati", "Fabrizio Fiorentino", "Phroilan Gardner", "Fausto Gutierrez"], "publishers": ["Ares Games", "Gremlin Project", "Devir", "GaGa Games", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Intrafin Games", "Planplay"], "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nSword & Sorcery is an epic-fantasy cooperative board game in which 1-5 players fight together against the forces of evil, which are controlled by the game system itself.\n\nEach player controls one or more heroes \u2013 legendary characters brought back to life by powerful sorcery.

In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age.

Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?\n\nIn Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:\n\n\n    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.\n    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!\n\n\nThe game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.\n\nEach player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items \u2014 but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.\n\nEach player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.\n\nYou can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.\n\nAt the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "178656", "name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"}, {"id": "191779", "name": "Brettspiel Easter Basket 2016"}, {"id": "255347", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Belle"}, {"id": "255348", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Cheyenne"}, {"id": "255349", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Django"}, {"id": "255350", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Doc"}, {"id": "255351", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Ghost"}, {"id": "255352", "name": "Colt Express: Bandits \u2013 Tuco"}, {"id": "213850", "name": "Colt Express: Cursed Loot"}, {"id": "181158", "name": "Colt Express: Horses & Stagecoach"}, {"id": "189394", "name": "Colt Express: Le tunnel avant l'arriv\u00e9e en gare"}, {"id": "191865", "name": "Colt Express: Marshal & Prisoners"}, {"id": "189189", "name": "Colt Express: North Pole Station"}, {"id": "302242", "name": "Colt Express: Promo Cards"}, {"id": "290189", "name": "Colt Express: The Santa Claus Elf"}, {"id": "186064", "name": "Colt Express: The Time Travel Car"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 6, "playingtime": 40, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 40, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 23941, "average": 7.13115, "bayesaverage": 6.99817, "stddev": 1.23591, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33417, "trading": 578, "wanting": 449, "wishing": 3296, "numcomments": 3691, "numweights": 799, "averageweight": 1.8185, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 381}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 85}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 341, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 226}, "2": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 38, "not_recommended_rating": 223}, "3": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 169, "not_recommended_rating": 94}, "4": {"best_rating": 107, "recommended_rating": 187, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "5": {"best_rating": 212, "recommended_rating": 79, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "6": {"best_rating": 178, "recommended_rating": 101, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "6+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 129}}}, "usersrated": 23941.0, "average": 7.13115, "bayesaverage": 6.99817, "stddev": 1.23591, "median": 0.0, "owned": 33417.0, "trading": 578.0, "wanting": 449.0, "wishing": 3296.0, "numcomments": 3691.0, "numweights": 799.0, "averageweight": 1.8185, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 381}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 85}], "game_family": "Colt Express", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "5", "num_expansions": 16, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "25613", "name": "Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization", "alternative_names": ["Cywilizacja: Poprzez wieki", "Im Wandel der Zeiten: Eine Geschichte der Zivilisation", "Through the Ages: Historia de las Civilizaciones", "Through the Ages: L'Histoire vous appartient", "Through the Ages: La Storia delle Civilt\u00e0", "Through the Ages: P\u0159\u00edb\u011bh civilizace", "\u6b77\u53f2\u5de8\u8f2a / \u5386\u53f2\u5de8\u8f6e", "\uc4f0\ub8e8 \ub514 \uc5d0\uc774\uc9c0\uc2a4: \uc778\ub958 \ubb38\uba85 \ubc1c\uc804 \ub300\uc11c\uc0ac\uc2dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3piN3YX4WmBRuIvbEG2Ygg__thumb/img/TDXIygWwAHKc2o90uGnnAhIa7_4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic236169.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3piN3YX4WmBRuIvbEG2Ygg__original/img/xeBBIO9BN7HGMxQdTw5zk5Hxou8=/0x0/pic236169.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Through the Ages", "Mechanism: Tableau Building"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Economic"], "implementations": ["Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Auction/Bidding", "Auction: Dutch", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "designers": ["Vlaada Chv\u00e1til"], "artists": ["Richard Cortes", "Paul Niemeyer"], "publishers": ["Czech Board Games", "Czech Games Edition", "DiceTree Games", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "HomoLudicus", "IELLO", "MINDOK", "Pegasus Spiele", "Portal Games", "Raven Distribution", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "description": "Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "98989", "name": "BGO Extended 2.0 expansion (fan expansion for Through the Ages)"}, {"id": "98607", "name": "Cywilizacja: Poprzez wieki \u2013 Polski dodatek 1"}, {"id": "98608", "name": "Cywilizacja: Poprzez wieki \u2013 Polski dodatek 2"}, {"id": "98880", "name": "Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization \u2013 Czech expansion"}, {"id": "136095", "name": "Through the Ages: Spanish Promo Card Set"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2006, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 120, "minplaytime": 120, "maxplaytime": 120, "minage": 12, "stats": {"usersrated": 17867, "average": 7.93599, "bayesaverage": 7.72568, "stddev": 1.68158, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17337, "trading": 925, "wanting": 634, "wishing": 4229, "numcomments": 3984, "numweights": 1801, "averageweight": 4.1749, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 44}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 36}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 671, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 5, "recommended_rating": 32, "not_recommended_rating": 295}, "2": {"best_rating": 165, "recommended_rating": 355, "not_recommended_rating": 46}, "3": {"best_rating": 430, "recommended_rating": 161, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "4": {"best_rating": 122, "recommended_rating": 256, "not_recommended_rating": 175}, "4+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 283}}}, "usersrated": 17867.0, "average": 7.93599, "bayesaverage": 7.72568, "stddev": 1.68158, "median": 0.0, "owned": 17337.0, "trading": 925.0, "wanting": 634.0, "wishing": 4229.0, "numcomments": 3984.0, "numweights": 1801.0, "averageweight": 4.1749, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 44}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 36}], "game_family": "Through the Ages", "reimplementation": true, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 5, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "25669", "name": "Qwirkle", "alternative_names": ["Qwirkle Deluxe", "Qwirkle \u00e9dition voyage", "Qwirkle Travel", "Qwirkle: Collector's Edition", "Qwirkle: Micky Mouse & Friends", "Qwirkle: The Simpsons", "Star Wars Qwirkle", "\u539f\u6728\u5f62\u8272\u68cb", "\u539f\u6728\u5f62\u8272\u68cb\uff1a\u65c5\u884c\u7248", "\ucffc\ud074", "\ud050\uc704\ud074"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k7zHj8j_a6uUAtXUt5Fvuw__thumb/img/APPui4zwBuwAIHXSTW6UxYcY6Ow=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic309353.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k7zHj8j_a6uUAtXUt5Fvuw__original/img/FnLhG5NDbel24voh8nbdYXAYji0=/0x0/pic309353.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Game: Qwirkle", "Misc: Mensa Select"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "implementations": ["Qwirkle Cards", "Qwirkle Cubes"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Pattern Building", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["Susan McKinley Ross"], "artists": [], "publishers": ["MindWare", "999 Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Compaya.hu - Gamer Caf\u00e9 Kft.", "Competo / Marektoy", "Corfix", "cutia.ro", "\u00c9veil & Jeux", "G3", "GoKids \u73a9\u6a02\u5c0f\u5b50", "Green Board Game Co.", "IELLO", "Inter Hobby Co., Ltd.", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "L\u00fadilo", "Outset Media", "Productief BV", "Schmidt Spiele"], "description": "The abstract game of Qwirkle consists of 108 wooden blocks with six different shapes in six different colors.

Each card in your hand that you don't play is passed on to your left-hand neighbor, so keep in mind how your play might set up theirs!\n\nWhen you add a new tile to the city, you take a \"power\" card of the same color, and these cards provide you additional abilities during the game, allowing you to scale up your building and point-scoring efforts.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "145399", "name": "Ginkgopolis: The Experts"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 1, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 45, "minplaytime": 45, "maxplaytime": 45, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 4841, "average": 7.42607, "bayesaverage": 6.97035, "stddev": 1.31242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4196, "trading": 69, "wanting": 897, "wishing": 2601, "numcomments": 1063, "numweights": 316, "averageweight": 2.9114, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 406}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 239}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 151, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 39, "not_recommended_rating": 32}, "2": {"best_rating": 63, "recommended_rating": 47, "not_recommended_rating": 15}, "3": {"best_rating": 64, "recommended_rating": 53, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "4": {"best_rating": 31, "recommended_rating": 61, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "5": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 44, "not_recommended_rating": 51}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 49}}}, "usersrated": 4841.0, "average": 7.42607, "bayesaverage": 6.97035, "stddev": 1.31242, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4196.0, "trading": 69.0, "wanting": 897.0, "wishing": 2601.0, "numcomments": 1063.0, "numweights": 316.0, "averageweight": 2.9114, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 406}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 239}], "game_family": "", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "3", "num_expansions": 1, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": false}, {"id": "302723", "name": "Forgotten Waters", "alternative_names": ["\u5fd8\u6d77\u4f20\u8bb0", "\ud3ec\uac00\ud2bc \uc6cc\ud130\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gLnzfyJio2MYbG9J-uQSiQ__thumb/img/Th5Wf0ynMEA14i06HUSqzz-8g24=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5253984.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gLnzfyJio2MYbG9J-uQSiQ__original/img/lcjIOMkPn-f11xVZ-13t-DNTyZY=/0x0/pic5253984.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Book as Board", "Components: Digital Hybrid - App Required", "Series: Crossroads (Plaid Hat Games)"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Nautical", "Pirates", "Travel"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Events", "Narrative Choice / Paragraph", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Semi-Cooperative Game", "Stat Check Resolution", "Storytelling", "Worker Placement"], "designers": ["Mr. Bistro", "J.

With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor \u2014 all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!\n\nConcordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:\n\n\n    They allow a player to choose actions during the game.\n    They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. \n\n\nConcordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, etc.) wins the game.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "325490", "name": "Concordia Solitaria"}, {"id": "209574", "name": "Concordia: 8 Forum Cards mini-expansion"}, {"id": "232917", "name": "Concordia: Aegyptus / Creta"}, {"id": "283177", "name": "Concordia: Balearica / Cyprus"}, {"id": "165023", "name": "Concordia: Britannia / Germania"}, {"id": "208364", "name": "Concordia: Gallia / Corsica"}, {"id": "181084", "name": "Concordia: Salsa"}, {"id": "262711", "name": "Concordia: Venus (Expansion)"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 100, "minplaytime": 100, "maxplaytime": 100, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 27181, "average": 8.12088, "bayesaverage": 7.96272, "stddev": 1.18694, "median": 0.0, "owned": 30897, "trading": 217, "wanting": 1609, "wishing": 8296, "numcomments": 4459, "numweights": 1137, "averageweight": 3.0343, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 18}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 16}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 443, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 223}, "2": {"best_rating": 44, "recommended_rating": 247, "not_recommended_rating": 57}, "3": {"best_rating": 135, "recommended_rating": 217, "not_recommended_rating": 4}, "4": {"best_rating": 249, "recommended_rating": 114, "not_recommended_rating": 6}, "5": {"best_rating": 56, "recommended_rating": 199, "not_recommended_rating": 64}, "5+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 158}}}, "usersrated": 27181.0, "average": 8.12088, "bayesaverage": 7.96272, "stddev": 1.18694, "median": 0.0, "owned": 30897.0, "trading": 217.0, "wanting": 1609.0, "wishing": 8296.0, "numcomments": 4459.0, "numweights": 1137.0, "averageweight": 3.0343, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 18}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 16}], "game_family": "Concordia", "reimplementation": false, "bestplayers": "4", "num_expansions": 8, "dice_tower_excellence": false, "susd": true}, {"id": "233867", "name": "Welcome To...", "alternative_names": ["K\u00f6sz\u00f6nt\u00fcnk... \u00e1lmaid v\u00e1ros\u00e1ban!", "V\u00edtejte ve sv\u00e9m vysn\u011bn\u00e9m domov\u011b", "Welcome to...
